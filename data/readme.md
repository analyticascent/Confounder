# Training Data

The CSV files in this folder contain various text samples for training text classifiers. Each row is a different sample and each column labels the samples by what information is present or omitted.

Confounder uses this to "learn" how to tell when new passages of text contain certain pieces of information or not, with an emphasis on inferring what statistical methodology was used to reach a conclusion about how two variables are related.

**Basically, the files in here contain the *training text* and *labels* needed to do supervised machine learning:**
