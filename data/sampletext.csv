Beyond the College Earnings Premium. Way Beyond.

By Philip Trostel  JANUARY 29, 2017

 

André da Loba for The Chronicle

A

t a time of rising tuition, it is understandable that

proponents of higher education trumpet the college

earnings premium. Despite the rising cost, a college

education is still practically a windfall-proﬁt investment for most

graduates. In 2012, Americans with bachelor’s degrees and without

advanced degrees earned over $32,000 a year more than high-school

graduates who never attended college.

Over an average lifetime, this premium is $1,383,000, conservatively

assuming that the earnings premium does not continue to increase,

as it has for decades. Moreover, with this ﬁnancial payoff comes the

value of substantially better health and longer life expectancy, the

value of employer-provided fringe beneﬁts such as health insurance and retirement plans, and the intrinsic lasting value of the

college experience. Paying the full sticker price at an elite private college just for the average beneﬁt is still a great investment.

But raising awareness of the college earnings premium has an important unintended side effect: It fuels the perception that a

college education is primarily a private good — that the only beneﬁciaries are the individuals earning degrees. And if a college

education is only a private good, then there is no need for public support of higher education. Private goods are effectively

provided in free markets, and it is only fair that the beneﬁciaries should be the ones to pay.

The increasing belief that a college education is mostly a private good is apparent in American public-spending priorities. Despite

rising college enrollment, the share of government spending devoted to higher education has been shrinking steadily since about

1980. Government spending on higher education as a fraction of national income has also been shrinking since the early 1980s.

Taxpayer contributions to higher education relative to net student/family contributions have decreased substantially in recent

decades. Our policy behavior speaks loudly that the perceived public value of a college education has been eroding.

And yet, higher education is clearly not just a private good. Knowledge creation from university research is an obvious public

good. This suggests using tax dollars to support such research, if not necessarily to support college attainment.

There are important public beneﬁts from college attainment, though. In addition to the great ﬁnancial payoff to graduates,

college attainment creates at least four important types of beneﬁts for others:

Increased productivity. Given the college earnings premium, it is hardly surprising that regions of the country with higher
proportions of college graduates have higher per capita incomes. The disparity, though, is substantially greater than can be

explained by the higher incomes of the graduates. In other words, a college education seems to create more aggregate income

than the sum of the higher incomes paid to graduates. It appears that a college education not only raises the productivity and

income of those getting the degrees but also raises the productivity and income of others.

Fiscal support. It is also hardly surprising that college graduates pay substantially more taxes than those who did not go to
college. Hence college graduates contribute more to the ﬁnancing of public goods that beneﬁt everyone. The magnitude of this

effect may be surprising. Over an average lifetime, graduates with bachelor’s degrees but without advanced degrees pay $563,000

more in taxes than high-school graduates who never attended college.

College graduates also create less in government expenditures on public assistance and social insurance, thus beneﬁting others

by freeing resources for other public services and/or reducing others’ taxes. Over an average lifetime, college graduates without

advanced degrees receive $50,000 less in Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, unemployment beneﬁts, and other such

beneﬁts than do high-school graduates who never attended college.

The additional taxes and the reduction in the need for beneﬁts that results from college attainment far exceed taxpayer support

for higher education, making college a great investment for taxpayers as well. Moreover, just the reduction in transfer payments

may exceed government spending on higher education, in which case public support for higher education may reduce the overall

size of government.

Philanthropic participation. College attendance increases generosity signiﬁcantly. College graduates without advanced degrees
donate more than three times as much cash to charities each year as do high-school graduates who never attended college. The

estimate errs on the low side because it not does include the value of noncash donations, posthumous gifts, or gifts to individuals.

The greater earnings of college graduates accounts for roughly half of the additional cash donations. The other half comes from

college graduates’ donating a higher proportion of their earnings to charity — 2.3 percent compared with 1.6 percent.

Volunteerism, too, increases signiﬁcantly with college attainment. Working-age bachelor’s graduates without advanced degrees

volunteer at 2.3 times the rate of high-school graduates who did not go to college. That puts total annual philanthropic

contributions more than $3,600 — 4.7 times — higher per bachelor’s degree. Total average contributions are 4.1 percent of

earnings for those with high-school diplomas, compared with 8.2 percent for those with bachelor’s degrees.

Civic engagement. College graduates are more-active participants in democracy, voting at higher rates and being more politically
involved. They are also more active in their neighborhoods through participation in community organizations, working on

community projects and attending community meetings. College-educated adults are also more likely to interact with their

neighbors. In addition, they are less likely to be involved in criminal activities. In short, college education helps make our

communities better places to live.

And these are just the measurable public beneﬁts. Their combined value is probably greater than the college earnings premium,

perhaps substantially so. The list does not include other vital public effects that are almost impossible to quantify, such as the

positive inﬂuences on arts, culture, innovation, and tolerance.

It is not overstatement to call the typically emphasized effect on earnings just a small portion of the beneﬁts of college

attainment. Yet the ﬁnancial payoff alone is too often portrayed as the sole beneﬁt of college. Until this portrayal of what makes a

college education worthwhile is changed, the longtime erosion of public support is likely to continue.

What’s more, access to a college education may well continue to be compromised, which makes not just the potential students

who are deterred, but all of us, worse off.

y • By Richard Rothstein • July 21, 2009

In response to a new study finding that only a small portion of 2009 college graduates had jobs lined up,
the National Journal posed the question How Can Colleges Help Graduates Pursue a Career? EPI
research associate Richard Rothstein argued that the problem rests not with the preparation colleges
were providing, but with larger economic trends, particularly a shortage of jobs. His complete response
follows:

Colleges and other educational institutions can influence which students get the more highly-skilled jobs
that are available. But colleges and other educational institutions cannot, to a significant extent, affect the
number of jobs that are available – highly skilled or otherwise.

This truth is obvious in our current economic crisis. Nobody can seriously believe that if colleges made
graduates more attractive job candidates, this would cause the unemployment rate for college graduates to
fall. If employers are now filling vacancies for recent college graduates in a number equal to only 20% of
their class, surely this is not because graduates are insufficiently attractive as candidates. The
unemployment rate for those with a college degree (including both mature workers and recent graduates)
was 4.8% in May, up from 2.1% at the start of the recession, and higher than at any time since 1979.

These unemployment numbers are probably understated. Anecdotes abound that many young college
graduates, though not technically unemployed, are forced to begin their careers as interns at low rates of
pay and sometimes with no pay at all. This phenomenon does not seem to be a product of the current
recession – it has apparently been growing even when the economy was strong. If there were truly an
economic shortage of well-educated workers, employers would have gobbled up these undercompensated
and uncompensated college graduates, at regular rates of pay.

The number of available jobs (including those that require college education and those that do not)
depends upon the size and growth of the economy, affected in turn by demand-side factors such as the
strength of consumer (public and private) demand and credit availability. Education reform cannot
influence such factors. 
Yet while this truth is obvious in today’s economic crisis, at other times many observers forget it and
assert a fiction: that if more students graduated from college as attractive job candidates, more would find
highly-skilled jobs requiring college education. This fiction assumes that when our economy is not in
recession, there is a shortage of college graduates available to fill jobs requiring college education.

But this fiction is just that. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has consistently projected that the number of
college graduates in the U.S. labor market will continue to match (or exceed) the number of job openings
requiring college education. Indeed, BLS finds that many of the largest areas of future job growth in the
American economy are in occupations requiring little skill, not even a two-year post-secondary credential
– waiters and waitresses, retail salespersons, truck drivers, janitors, home health aides. This reality will
not be changed if only colleges could make their graduates more attractive candidates.

Many of those who see a skills crisis in the American economy, attributable to inadequate education,
confuse the fastest growing job categories with the job categories having the largest openings. It is true
that many (though not all) of the fastest growing categories require post-secondary education, but this fast
growth starts from relatively small bases, so does not generate many new jobs for college graduates.

Others point to the gap in wages between college and high school graduates, a gap that at some (but not
all) times during recent decades has grown, and conclude that this reflects a supply-demand imbalance. In
reality, during much of the last 40 years, the wages of college-educated workers in science, technology,
engineering and math have been stagnant or growing very slowly. The giant wage gains of college
graduates in some recent years are attributable to big boosts in compensation of managers and sales
workers (for example, in Wall Street and similar finance occupations). It is hard to take seriously a claim
that the giant bonuses paid to finance workers in the last decade are indicative of a nationwide shortage of
college graduates.

In actuality, the demand for college graduates has slowed considerably since the 1980s, even at times
when the college-high school wage premium was growing. 
My colleague at the Economic Policy Institute, Lawrence Mishel, and I have, in previous work, noted
that productivity growth in the American economy has been extraordinary until the recent economic
crisis, especially in comparison to that of other industrialized countries. If the American workforce did
not have sufficient skills to use the most advanced available technology, such productivity growth could
not have been possible.

Much of our education policy in recent years has been driven by the inaccurate belief that if only all
students could qualify for post-secondary education and then become “attractive job candidates,” all
youth would then obtain well-compensated jobs that took advantage of these qualifications.

But our true challenge is quite different. When this recession is over, it will still be the case that attractive
candidates for jobs requiring a college education will not be in short supply. And if we succeed in
preparing more students for college, and supporting them as they complete it, an economic surplus of
college graduates will grow. With hourly compensation for college graduates flat from 2002 to 2008, this
can only mean that pay will start declining. It is already the case that new college graduates earn less and
get less generous benefits than those at the beginning of this decade. The economic issue is not how to
generate more and better-prepared college graduates. Rather, our challenge is to break a system where the
best predictor of which students obtain a college education and access to the limited number of good jobs
available is so easily predicted by the race, education, and material circumstances of those students’
parents.

In a contemporary environment where only 20% of college graduates can find jobs appropriate to their
education and training, this inequity can only get worse. 
Confronting this inequity, in a social and economic system where occupational privilege is necessarily
limited, requires changes in our social, economic, and educational institutions that go beyond improving
the quality of preparation received by college graduates. For example, if we are serious about increasing
the competitiveness of minority youth for a limited number of the most desirable jobs, we must make this
competition more palatable for advantaged youths who, in greater numbers than before, may lose out. It is
hard to imagine how losing can be made more palatable without making the consequences of losing less
severe-ensuring that those with only a high school or associate college degree (roughly sixty percent of
the workforce), and even college graduates who cannot find employment requiring a college degree, have
jobs which are decently paid. This will require addressing the excessive income inequa 
lity we’ve developed as a nation, not a topic usually considered by educators or education experts.

Nothing I have said here should be taken to minimize the importance of getting more young people
prepared for college, and through it. We may have an economic surplus of college graduates, but not a
cultural or civic surplus. There are many reasons to raise the educational level of our population besides
workforce preparation. But the notions that we face an economic calamity if we don’t dramatically boost
the number of college graduates, or that inadequate college preparation is stunting their access to jobs, is
simply wrong.

A College Education of Diminishing Returns

The Law of Diminishing Returns is a nasty little ordinance…and few aspects of life escape its
tyranny.

A short list of exceptions would include sex and world peace…or at least world peace. (To be
sure about sex, a poll of long-married couples might be necessary). Suﬃce to say that this
Law wields more power over life than any formal statute in the US penal code.

For proof of this fact, consider the lamentable condition of “the college education.” Once
upon a time, a college education in America was a one-way ticket to a high-paying job and a
lofty socio-economic status. Part of its value derived from the fact that a college education
was relatively rare. In 1950, only about 5% of all Americans held a bachelor’s degree.

Since this 5% tended to fare so much better than the rest of the American population, lots of
folks began to ask themselves, “Why not send as many kids as possible to college?”

This simple question sparked what would become a massive “college bubble.” This simple
question spawned myriad scholarship programs, a college-construction boom…and Sallie
Mae – née the Student Loan Marketing Association in 1972.

Today, more than 25% of Americans hold a bachelor’s degree – five times more than in 1950.
But guess what? A bachelor’s degree ain’t what it used to be. The Law of Diminishing
Returns is having its way.

According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, more than half of all 2007
college graduates who had applied for a job had received an offer by Graduation Day. In
2008, that percentage tumbled to 26%, and to less than 20% last year. Statistics like these do
not inspire confidence in a college degree.

More and more Americans have Alma Maters for which to cheer; but fewer and fewer have
employment prospects worth cheering about. While it’s true that a college degree tends to
correlate with a relatively high income, the nearby chart clearly shows that this relative high
is drifting lower. During the last eight to ten years, the median income of highly educated
Americans has been declining.

These statistics are troubling, even before examining their price tag. And what a price tag it
is! The average annual tuition (plus expenses) at a private nonprofit four-year college is
about $35,000. That’s $140,000 for four years – or just a little bit less than the median cost of
an American home. How did prices ever get this crazy?

Thank Sallie Mae – vendor extraordinaire of student loans. Thanks to Sallie, and the industry
she pioneered, most of the nation’s college graduates now possess far more debt than
opportunity. According to FinAid.org, the total amount of money Americans have borrowed
on government and private student loans at $830 billion has surpassed the total American
consumer balance on credit cards, only $827 billion. But the problems wrought by Sallie
Mae are far more pervasive and insidious than mere indebtedness.

Were it not for Sallie Mae, aspiring college graduates could never have borrowed far more
money than they could ever hope to repay; universities could never have begun to believe
that they are worth what they charge; professors could never have obtained their coddled
lifestyles and the cost of a college education could never have appreciated well beyond any
connection to its true economic value.

And herein lies the dirty little truth about an advanced degree – it doesn’t always do much
advancing.

“Sometimes things we believe for good reason our whole lives turn out one day to no longer
be true, because circumstances have changed,” writes Jack Hough in a delightful little article
for SmartMoney. “Consider two childhood friends, Ernie and Bill. Hard workers with helpful
families, each saves exactly $16,594 for college. Ernie doesn’t get accepted to a school he
likes. Instead, he starts work at 18 and invests his college savings in a mutual fund that tracks
the broad stock market.

“Throughout his life,” Hough continues, “Ernie makes average yearly pay for a high school
graduate with no college, starting at $15,901 after taxes and peaking at $32,538. Each month,
he adds to his stock fund 5% of his after-tax income, close to the nation’s current savings
rate. It returns 8% a year, typical for stock investors.

“Bill has a typical college experience. He gets into a public college and after two years
transfers to a private one. He spends $49,286 on tuition and required fees, the average for
such a track. I’m not counting room and board, since Bill must pay for his keep whether he
goes to college or not. Bill gets average-size grants, adjusted for average probabilities of
receiving them, and so pays $34,044 for college.

“He leaves school with an average-size student loan and a good interest rate: $17,450 at 5%.
The $16,594 he has saved for college, you see, is precisely enough to pay what his loans don’t
cover.

“Bill will have higher pay than Ernie his whole life,” Hough relates, “starting at $23,505 after
taxes and peaking at $56,808. Like Ernie, he sets aside 5%. At that rate, it will take him 12
years to pay off his loan. Debt-free at 34, he starts adding to the same index fund as Ernie,
making bigger monthly contributions with his higher pay. But when the two reunite at 65 for
a retirement party, Ernie will have grown his savings to nearly $1.3 million. Bill will have less
than a third of that.

“How can that be?” Hough asks rhetorically. “College degrees bring higher income, but at
today’s cost they can’t make up the savings they consume and the debt they add early in the
life of a typical student. While Ernie was busy earning, Bill got stuck under his bill.”

“The great enemy of the truth,” John F. Kennedy declared in a 1962 commencement address
at Yale University, “is very often not the lie – deliberate, contrived and dishonest – but the
myth – persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.”

Fifty years later, a Yale education, itself, may be one small part of a vast American myth.
Send your kids to Yale if you want; but don’t be surprised if the grads over at New Haven
High are faring better financially a few years from now.

As a well-heeled acquaintance from Manhattan quipped recently, “Hey it’s gonna cost me
$250,000 to send my kid to an Ivy League school. I’d rather just use the money to buy him a
business, and let him figure it out in the real world.”

The logic is compelling.

Snapshot for February 22, 2006.

It is conventional wisdom that earnings have grown faster for college graduates than for high-school
graduates.  This long-term wage trend has led economists to conclude that the skill demands of American
employers have outpaced the supply of skilled workers in the U.S. labor market, thus demonstrating a
shortage of college-educated workers.

In his first testimony as Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke called this increase in the “skill
premium” the “most important factor” in explaining the increase in inequality.  The new version of the
Economic Report of the President (ERP), written under Bernanke as chairman of the Bush Administration
Council of Economic Advisers, makes the same argument.

There is, however, a problem with this reasoning: according to the ERP’s own data, the wage premium
for skill has contracted sharply over this business cycle. Since 2000, the real earnings of college-educated
workers (those with bachelor’s degrees) have fallen quite steeply, while the earnings of high-school
graduates have gone up.  So according to Bernanke’s and the ERP’s logic, such  results would suggest
that, since 2000, the supply of college graduates (typically labeled “skilled workers” in this debate) has
grown faster than employers’ need for them, and that the supply of high-school graduates (“less-skilled
workers”) has not kept up with demand.  Obviously, such a trend undermines claims that it’s the skill
level of U.S. workers that is the chief factor behind the growth in inequality.

Figure 1, taken from the ERP (Table 2-1), shows the increase in the ratio of annual earnings of college to
high-school workers.  This ratio increased from 57% to 93% in the 1975-2000 period, a significant
increase in the relative earnings of college graduates; it is this trend that has informed much of the debate
regarding the alleged “skills mismatch” of the U.S. workforce.

Between 2000 and 2004, however, there is a large decline in this ratio, driven by the 5.2% fall in the real
earnings of college graduates over this period (Figure 2 ) that coincided with an increase (albeit modest)
in high-school graduates earnings.

Of course, even with this sharp loss, college workers have a significant earnings advantage over those
with lower levels of education, and the Bush Council of Economic Advisers is absolutely right to stress
the importance of a highly educated workforce. 

Nevertheless, policy makers and “futurists” predicting a shortage of skilled labor need to be aware of this
reversal in the college premium, especially since it contradicts their explanation of evolving skill
demands.  It’s possible that the recent results could represent a short-term reversal of a trend that will
soon revert back to its prior course (our own research, however, shows that the trend in the college
premium flattened in the latter 1990s).1 

We could, however, also be witnessing the downward pressure on the earnings growth of college-
educated workers due to the offshoring of skilled jobs that had in earlier years commanded a significant
2
earnings premium.

4,"The college earnings premium is near
record highs

Lisa Scherzer August 10, 2016

It’s been a pretty solidly established fact by now, but in case there’s any
lingering doubt about whether it’s worth it to go to college, here’s more
evidence.

The college earnings premium—the ratio of earnings for those with a
college degree to earnings for those with a high school degree—has
reached historical highs in recent years.

Council of Economic Advisers

In 2014, the median full-time, full-year worker over age 25 with a
bachelor’s degree earned nearly 70% more than a similar worker with
just a high school degree. Jason Furman, head of the White House’s
Council of Economic Advisers tweeted out this chart illustrating the
earnings premium after the July jobs report was released last Friday,
citing findings from a July report by the CEA.

Over the course of a career, the median worker with a bachelor’s degree
will earn nearly $1 million more than the same type of full-time worker
with just a high school diploma, according to the CEA report which
covers trends in student borrowing and repayment. The same type of
worker with an associate’s degree earns a premium of about $360,000.
(It does, however, take longer for some to break even on their college
investment than others, as Goldman Sachs pointed out last year.)

“Higher education may be the single most important investment that
young Americans can make in their futures,” the authors wrote. (The
CEA report also touts President Obama’s PAYE plan which caps
monthlystudent loan payments at 10% of discretionary income, and
which the White House says is benefiting nearly 5 million borrowers.)

In addition to higher earnings, college graduates are also 1.3 times more
likely to work than those with just a high school degree. The report cites
BLS data showing that college graduates with “at least a bachelor’s
degree participate in the labor force at a higher rate than high school
graduates (74% vs. 57% in 2015) and also face a lower unemployment
rates among those who participate (2.6% vs. 5.4% in 2015).”

Council of Economic Advisers

And, by the way, in June Georgetown University Center on Education
and the Workforce gave yet more weight to the college-is-worth-it
argument with its report that found that out of the 11.6 million jobs
created in the post-recession economy, 11.5 million went to workers with
at least some college education. And of those jobs, 8.4 million went to
workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher.
 
Another bonus for grads: they have higher odds of moving up the
economic ladder and experience “a wide range of non-economic benefits
like health and happiness,” according to the CEA report, which cites past
research.

Despite the stark difference in earnings and employment between the
degree-haves and have-nots, the report delves into why some students,
burdened by their student loans, don’t end up better off after college.

Here are 3 more takeaways from the report:

College returns vary and it’s especially bad for for-profit students

Overall, the financial benefits of a college education are high, but of
course, it doesn’t work always work out great for everyone – particularly
for those who attend for-profit schools.

The years following the Great Recession saw a spike in student-loan
borrowing, driven largely by students attending for-profit and community
colleges and by those from low-income families. The problem is that
many of these schools “yield low or even negative returns, especially for
students who do not complete degrees,” according to the study. Between
2009 and 2015, outstanding debt grew by 158% for community college
borrowers and 142% for for-profit borrowers, compared to an overall
increase of 107% in outstanding undergraduate debt.

For a comparison, check out this chart:

Council of Economic Advisers

After three years, borrowers from nonprofit and four-year public schools
have paid down 15% of their original balance on the whole, compared
with only 8% and 3% at community colleges and for-profits, respectively.

For-profit students, the CEA report says, are “more likely to be
unemployed, to default on their loans, and to say that their education
was not worth the cost.”

Size of your loan matters

Outstanding student debt in the US has reached a whopping $1.3 trillion
as of 2015. And although individual federal debt levels have been
mushrooming and outstanding balances of $40,000 or more are not
uncommon, there is a bright spot: the debt burden owed by the typical
student is on the “modest” side.

As of June 2015, the majority of borrowers with outstanding
undergraduate loans owed less than $20,000 (the average amount of
undergraduate loans held in 2015 was $17,900); 42% owed less than
$10,000; and only 10% owed more than $40,000, the CEA says. It’s
typically graduate-school borrowers who have heftier debt loads: 43%
owed more than $40,000 in graduate loans.

Dropouts fare worse

Who’s most likely to default on their student loans? According to the
CEA, low-income borrowers, those who attend for-profit or community
colleges, part-timers, and especially, those who don’t finish their
degrees.

Defaults are concentrated among borrowers with small-volume loans, in
large part because these borrowers are less likely to have completed
their degrees. Loans of less than $10,000 accounted for nearly two-
thirds of all defaults for the 2011 cohort three years after entering
repayment. Loans of less than $5,000 accounted for 35% of all defaults.

The report found that among undergraduate borrowers who entered
repayment in 2011, those who didn’t finish their degree defaulted at a
25% rate after three years, compared with just 9% among those who did
complete. And after three years, 58% of degree-holders had paid back at
least a dollar of their loans, contributing to a 14% decline in their original
balance. Of those who didn’t finish, only 39% of had paid down a dollar
of their initial balance and 94% of their original balance remained unpaid
after three years.

ABSTRACT 

The Returns to Elite College Education: 

A Quasi-Experimental Analysis* 

 
I take advantage of a sharp discontinuity in the probability of admission to an elite university 
at the admission score threshold, to estimate causal returns to college education quality. I 
use  a  newly  constructed  dataset,  which  combines  individual  administrative  records  about 
high school, college admission, college attendance and tax returns. Students with score just 
above  the  admission  threshold  have  52%  higher  yearly  income  with  respect  to  just-below-
threshold students. This premium is equivalent to a jump from the 44th percentile to the 74th 
percentile  of  the  income  distribution.  The  richness  of  the  data  allows  me  to  explore  the 
counterfactual  college  career  of  not  admitted  students  and  the  potential  mechanisms 
underlying  the  estimated  income  premium.  I  find  that  students  with  a  just-above-threshold 
score  are  less  likely  to  be  college  dropouts,  take  six  fewer  months  to  graduate,  choose 
different  majors  and  are  more  likely  to  have  income  in  the  top  quartile  of  the  distribution. 
Cumulated over fifteen years, the time span of income data for my sample, the net premium 
of attending the elite university amounts to around $120,000.

Introduction

Every year, students pay higher tuition to attend elite universities because they observe

higher returns for their graduates. But to what extent diﬀerences in earnings reﬂect better

students selecting into elite institutions? Estimating causal returns to education quality is

a complex endeavor because students select into better universities based on unobservable

characteristics that may also be correlated with higher potential earnings. While this se-

lection issue has been extensively analyzed by the literature on the returns to education

attainment (Angrist and Krueger 1991, Ashenfelter and Krueger 1994, Duﬂo 2002, Ichino

and Winter-Eber 2004), few studies have tackled it credibly in the context of returns to ed-

ucation quality. Estimates of the returns to college quality obtained without accounting for

selection tend to overestimate the returns to attendance of a highly selective college.1 In the

recent years, there has been intense debate about tuition fee hikes and excessive students’

borrowing. The Obama administration has long worked to construct a ranking (a “college

scorecard”2) aimed at helping students choose colleges that “oﬀer good value for their tu-

ition dollars”3 and linking federal funding to it. While the scorecard provides substantial

information on the cost of attendance and median earnings of graduates for each univer-

sity separately, the government has abandoned the goal of publishing an actual ranking of

universities. Rankings based on graduates’ average or median earnings may indeed give a

misleading representation of the value added of diﬀerent universities and thus cause intense

discontent among university administrators.4

To isolate the causal returns to educational quality, previous studies have used several

econometric techniques. Dale and Krueger (2002,2011) compare earnings of graduates of

selective college to those of students admitted at equally selective universities, but chose to

1As shown in Hoxby (2009), diﬀerences in terms of selectivity among U.S. universities are massive.

3From the New York Times of August 20th2013
4Alternative rankings, not based on earnings, have been proposed by other scholars. Avery et al. (2013)
for example make use of college choices of high-achieving students to create a revealed preference ranking of
American colleges and universities).

attend less selective institutions. They ﬁnd positive returns only for low-income students.

Brewer et al. (1999) model high school students’ choice of university and estimate a 40%

earning premium for attending an elite private institution relative to attending public uni-

versities. Other studies rely on the comparison of twins: Behrman et al. (1996) focus on

female twins and ﬁnd evidence of positive returns to attending private universities with well-

paid senior faculty, while Lindahl and Regner (2005) use Swedish sibling data and show that

within-family estimates of the wage premium to college quality are half of the cross-sectional

estimates. Andrews et al. (2012) focus instead on quantile treatment eﬀects and compare

the wage distribution of graduates from a ﬂagship state university to a counterfactual wage

distribution of students from non-selective institutions that assumes same observable char-

acteristics as for the selective university. They ﬁnd an 11.5% premium for attending the

ﬂagship state university. Several other works use a regression discontinuity approach to

deal with selection in various educational contexts (Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2014, Hastings et

al. 2013). Hoekstra (2009) exploits a discontinuity in the admission rule of a U.S. ﬂagship

state university and estimates a 24% premium in earnings for its graduates. Saavedra (2008)

examines the extent to which college quality aﬀects students learning, employment and earn-

ings in Colombia. More recent works use also a regression discontinuity design to estimate

returns to elite college education on the marriage market (Kaufmann et al. 2013), returns

across degree programs (Hastings et al. 2013, Kirkeboen et al. 2014) and the returns to

college admission for students that are at the margin of attending university (Zimmermann

2014).

In this paper, I expand and improve on the approach used by Hoekstra (2009). I control

for selection into elite college education by exploiting a sharp discontinuity in probability of

admission to an elite Italian university at the admission score threshold. I use self-collected

administrative data from the city of Milan that combine individual high school data, college

admission data, college performance and tax returns to estimate labor market returns to

attending the private elite college for graduates between 24 and 39 years old. I am also able

3

to link family and spatial background information. My quasi-experimental approach relies on

the assumption that applicants obtaining a score close to the admission threshold are locally

randomly assigned to elite university attendance.

Idiosyncratic shocks in admission test

performance and relative academic quality make admission close to the unknown threshold

as good as random. Several tests consistently validate this fact.

This paper oﬀers several important contributions to the literature. First, I am able to

track university choices, academic performance and labor market outcomes of the coun-

terfactual college careers of individuals not admitted.5 To my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst

paper to use administrative data available for both admitted and not-admitted students to

shed light on the mechanisms through which college quality aﬀects individual labor market

outcomes. Second, the “sharp” nature of the discontinuity in the admission probability of-

fers a methodological improvement. Admissions at the elite university that I consider are

based on a uni-dimensional numerical score. No subjective evaluations such as recommen-

dation letters or essays are considered for admission. This allows me to predict perfectly

the admission outcome as a function of the admission score. Third, the nature of the higher

education market in Milan provides a common support of students attending universities

with substantially diﬀerent degrees of selectivity and quality. I compare the position in the

Italian income distribution of graduates of universities in Milan vis-a-vis the position in the

US income distribution of graduates of US universities. I ﬁnd that the median graduate at

the elite university in my setting earns as much as a graduate of Duke University, while the

counterfactual student graduating in other non-selective universities in Milan earns approx-

imately like a graduate of Durham Technical Community College (the local college for Duke

University). While in the U.S. students who just missed admission at Duke University are

most likely attending a similar-quality college elsewhere in the country, in my setting the

jump in university quality and selectivity for just-below-threshold students is substantial.

Fourth, the fact that I focus on a geographically delimited labor market with low mobility

5Hoekstra (2009) did not have the counterfactual college information available

4

for graduates allows for a proper comparison of income across individuals.6 This allows

me to overcome concerns about regional earnings heterogeneity that aﬀects college quality

estimates in markets with high mobility of college graduates such as the U.S. one.

My estimates show that attending the elite university yields an average 52% premium in

yearly income. In distributional terms, this premium is equivalent to a shift from the 44th

percentile of Italy’s national income distribution to the 74th percentile. The U.S.-distribution-

equivalent yearly income premium would be $19,952, which corresponds to roughly 65% of the

U.S. College/high school premium. I take into account the higher tuition fees for attending

the elite university and I estimate that the cumulative discounted net returns to enrolling at

the elite university 15 years after graduation are $120,000 (EUR 108,535). I calculate that

40% of the observed diﬀerence in average income between graduates of the elite university

and other college graduates can be attributed to selection. I also explore the heterogeneity

of the R.D. estimates along the income distribution and ﬁnd that attendance at the elite

university is linked to a “lottery eﬀect” at the threshold. Students with an admission score

just above threshold are 66% more likely to be in the top quartile of the income distribution.

The eﬀects I ﬁnd are sizeable. Thanks to the richness of my data, I can exploit counter-

factual information of students that were not admitted at the elite university and explore

the potential underlying mechanisms.

I ﬁnd that students that are just-above threshold

for admission to the elite university are more likely to complete a college degree, take 6

fewer months to graduate and are exposed to a far better selected set of peers. When inter-

preting the magnitude of the estimated premium it is important to take into account that

the elite university focuses on degrees in economics and business. I check for the presence

of a discontinuity in the choice of major at the admission score threshold and ﬁnd that

just-above-threshold students are 30 percentage points more likely to choose economics or

business as their major. After taking into account the eﬀect of the diﬀerent major choices

on income, I ﬁnd that the “net” institutional quality eﬀect of attending the elite university

6Most of the students graduating from universities in Milan end up working in the Milan metropolitan

area, as it is one of the most thriving and productive regions of Europe

5

is approximately 30%.

These results provide new evidence of the large returns to attending a top quality col-

lege compared to not-selective institutions, even after controlling for selection in a quasi-

experimental setting. The analysis of the mechanisms and the methodology used in this

paper represent important contributions for both the literature and education policy.

2 Data and setting

The master sample in the analysis consists of a group of 30,000 individuals who graduated

from college preparatory high schools (in Italian, “Licei”) between 1985 and 2005 in the city

of Milan (Italy), a large service-oriented metropolitan area in the wealthiest part of Italy.

College educated individuals from this city often become part of the Italian elite in business,

ﬁnance and academia. High school data for these individuals have been collected from 13

diﬀerent high schools and contain information on high school exit test, class peers, teachers

and the location of their home. The high school master data have been linked to multiple

sources of administrative data as illustrated in Figure 1. They have been matched (using

names and date of birth) to student records at the 5 main universities in Milan. These

universities oﬀer a broad set of majors and are considered in the country. Every year, there

are around 40,000 freshman students and a total of 160,000 students attending college in

Milan (Italian Ministry of Education, 2014). The majority of the students that graduate

from college preparatory high schools in Milan applies to one of these 5 universities. In this

speciﬁc sample, 83% of all high school graduates obtain a college degree and among all college

graduates almost 90% of them are matched to the data of at least one of the 5 universities in

Milan.7 For the matched students I am able to reconstruct their university career: whether

they graduated, in what year, in what ﬁeld of study, in what university and with what ﬁnal

exit score. In a further step, the initial 30,000 records of the college preparatory high school

7Of the 10% unmatched students graduating from college, 68% attended another Italian university outside

Milan, while the rest went abroad for their college studies.

6

graduates have been linked to internal revenue service data on personal gross income for year

2005, the only year for which I was able to obtain individual administrative records.8 The

home addresses where students lived during high school have been geocoded and matched

to house market values.9 Moreover, for a stratiﬁed 10% random sub-sample of all high

school graduates, more detailed information has been collected from telephone interviews

conducted in June 2011.10 The additional information include many variables such as family

background, parental income, job and education, current employment and current family

situation of the individual.

Finally, I have merged these data with records from the admission oﬃce of the most

selective university among the ﬁve in Milan. The admission oﬃce performed the match

using the name, birth date, high school and year of high school graduation of each individual

and returned the matched data after full anonymization. The admission oﬃce matched

information for all high school students in the master data (both admitted and not admitted).

However, the university has kept digital databases for the admission sessions from 1995

onwards, half of the cohorts available in my data. Figure B1 graphically shows the “time-

line” of admission information availability. Every year on the time axis represents a cohort

of students graduating from Milan college-preparatory high schools and applying to college

in that year. As summarized in Figure B1, data on admission for the elite university for the

1995 to 2005 high school cohorts and not for the 1985 to 1994 ones. Background information,

high school and college performance data, income for tax year 2005 and phone survey data

obtained in 2011 are available for all cohorts.

8The administrative ﬁle of reported income includes all individuals in the country and it is mandatory to
report any income. If a person does not appear is because he/she has no income or he/she lives outside the
country. Self-employed are included in the sample.

9House value data have been provided by the governmental agency “Agenzia del Territorio” for 55 neigh-

borhoods of the city

2.1 The elite university under analysis

Table 1 summarizes relevant statistics for the elite university vis-a-vis the average char-

acteristics of the other four universities of Milan under analysis. The elite university is

characterized by substantially diﬀerent institutional characteristics, degrees of selectivity

and outcomes. It is smaller in size (has around 11,000 students enrolled every year with

respect to an average of 39,000 for the other universities), has 93% higher expenditures per

student, 13% higher salaries per instructor, but does not have a better student-to-instructors

ratio. Net of scholarships and tuition fee discounts, attending the elite university costs 3.7

times more on average than the other universities11.

Students attending the elite university are highly selected on their pre-college charac-

teristics. Their high school exit scores12 are substantially (44%) higher. While the average

student attending the elite university scores in the 71th percentile of the Milan high school

exit score distribution, the average student in the other 4 universities scores in the 48th per-

centile. When compared to the U.S. distribution in the SAT composite score, this diﬀerence

is equivalent to a 210 points gap (a score of 1680 vs 1470). Students at the elite university

also come from wealthier families, have more educated mothers and their fathers are 42%

more likely to work in leadership occupations.13

Average diﬀerences in students’ outcomes are also substantial. Students graduating from

the elite university have average annual income (between 1 and 15 years after graduation)

that is 87% higher than graduates of the other four universities. In distributional terms,

while the average income of an elite university graduate lies at the 85th percentile of the

2005 Italian income distribution, the one of a graduate of the other Milan universities is at

the 44th percentile. The U.S.-distribution-equivalent yearly income gap is higher than $40,000

($64,369 vs $23,886 in the 2005 U.S. income distribution). More than 60% of them (between

elite university under analysis, while the other state universities require low token fees

and graded by external committees. Scores are thus comparable across schools.

25 and 45 years old) work in leadership occupations (managers, professionals, directors or

business-owners) with respect to 39% of other graduates. They are also more likely to work

abroad. However, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the employment rate of the graduates

of the elite university, with very high employment rates (above 90%) of all college graduates

in Milan.

In Table 2 I compare labor market outcomes and selectivity of the universities under

analysis with the U.S. university system. I use the data provided by the U.S. Department

of Education College Scorecard14 to compare Milan college students with students of US

universities. In the top panel, I use the U.S.-income-distribution-equivalent income of Milan

college students (as calculated in Table 1) and compare it with the income of U.S. college

graduates. While the median graduate of the elite university under analysis is placed in

the income distribution similarly to graduates of Duke University and Carnagie Mellon, the

median graduate of all other Milan universities is placed much further down in the income

distribution at levels comparable to substantially lower ranked colleges in the same states of

Duke University and Carnagie Mellon (respectively, Durham Technical Community College

and the Community College of Philadelphia).

In the bottom panel of Table 2, I exploit

the SAT-distribution equivalent score (as calculated in Table 1) to compare the selectivity

of the universities under analysis to the selectivity of U.S. colleges. While in terms of

graduates’ income the elite university is comparable to top-ranked U.S. universities, it is

less selective than top-ranked U.S. distribution (comparable to good state universities such

as UC-Irvine and UC-Santa Cruz). On the other end, the non-elite universities in Milan

have an extremely low level of selectivity compared to the U.S. system. Table 2 shows that

the elite vs. non-elite universities selectivity gap in my data is comparable to the diﬀerence

between UC-Santa Cruz or UC-Irvine and schools such as the California Baptist University

of Riverside or Fresno Paciﬁc University. This gap is not surprising since, contrary to the

elite university, the other universities in Milan did not have admission tests for most of the

14https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

period under consideration.15

Two important features of Italian university education (features that are in common

with all other European countries) are relevant for this study. First, admission to Italian

universities is degree-speciﬁc: students apply for a speciﬁc ﬁeld of study at one or more

universities. In order to change degree after enrollment, a student must wait for the following

round of admissions (once a year) and make a new application. Where an admission test

is required, it is administered by the single university. There is no centralized admission

system. Second, not every university oﬀers degrees in all ﬁelds of study. In Figure B2 I show

the breakdown of enrollment at each university and in each ﬁeld of study in my sample.

The elite university oﬀers degrees in Business, Economics and Law16 with a wide range of

specializations, from public policy to “management of arts, culture and fashion”. Its mission

emphasizes the preparation of managers and leaders with a strong economic background in a

very wide range of ﬁelds. For this reason the elite university attracts a large part of students

with preferences for degrees diﬀerent from Economics and Business as showed later on in

this paper.17

Overall, the descriptive statistics show that students who attend the elite university

are highly selected on pre-college characteristics and have substantially better labor market

outcomes. This suggests that selection bias might play an important role in determining

the large gap in student outcomes. The quasi-experimental analysis presented in the next

sections will shed light on the relevance of this selection bias.

15Exceptions are Engineering, Architecture and Medicine programs in the recent years.
16The faculty of Law opened during the years under analysis, but it was very small. Thus, in my analysis

I focus on individuals applying for Business and Economics only.

17Degrees in Economics and Business are also oﬀered by the other private university in the sample and
one of the public universities (“Public university 3” in the diagram). The three public universities represent
a large share of all college students in Milan and their degree oﬀerings respond to both specialization and
scale criteria: “Public university 1” in ﬁg. B2) focuses on engineering, architecture and design while the
other two have a large set of ﬁelds. “Private university 2” focuses on social sciences, including Humanities,
Economics, Business and Education.

10

2.2 The admission rule

The admission procedure of the elite university is based on an objective uni-dimensional

composite score that equally weights the high school exit exam score and the admission test

score.18 Applicants are ranked according to this score. Every year, the number of admitted

students is ﬁxed at N before the admission test is taken and every year the N students

with the highest composite score are oﬀered admission.19 It is very diﬃcult for applicants to

predict the admission score cutoﬀ because of idiosyncratic shocks to applicants’ performance

in the admission test, the relative diﬃculty of the admission test, cohort size and the quality

of students attempting the test each year. The admissions oﬃce of the elite university

provided the exact score and ranking position of each applicant.

Figure 2 shows the discontinuity in the probability of admission and enrollment at the

admission threshold for applicants. The composite admission score has been standardized

for each admission session and then re-scaled to be 0 at the admission threshold. The

standardized score can thus be interpreted as the number of standard deviations from the

admission threshold, allowing me to pool together individuals applying to diﬀerent admission

sessions over the years. While until year 1999 there was a single admission threshold per year

for the entire university, starting from the year 2000 admissions were determined separately

for each speciﬁc degree (e.g. business degree, economics degree, marketing degree, etc. ) and

thus several rankings and admission thresholds were determined each year. For admissions

after 2000, I have thus re-scaled each degree-speciﬁc admission threshold to be 0. Given the

objective nature of admission scores, I am able to identify a sharp discontinuity in probability

of admission. Since not every admitted student ends up enrolling at the elite university, the

discontinuity in the probability of enrolling at the elite university is not sharp, although it

is very large. About 70% of admitted students in my sample end up enrolling in the elite

18The admission test is administered by the elite university simultaneously for all students, is multiple

choice and is identical for all students.

19In the years under analysis there were on average 3200 students attempting the test with 2200 spots

available (68% admission rate).

university. There are two possible reasons for which students admitted to the elite university

may decide not to enroll. Either the students prefer to major in a ﬁeld not oﬀered by the

elite university (e.g. engineering) or they may be credit constrained (tuition at the elite

university is almost four times higher than tuition at the other universities).

In my analysis, I exploit the sharp discontinuity in the probability of admission to estimate

the eﬀect of admission on income. This can be interpreted as an “intent to treat” eﬀect, since

not all admitted students actually attend the elite university. I also use a fuzzy discontinuity

approach to estimate the eﬀect of enrolling at the elite university on income.

3

Identiﬁcation strategy

Given the sharp nature of the discontinuity in the probability of admission, I ﬁrst estimate

the eﬀect of admission on income with a parametric RD model with ﬂexible polynomials of

diﬀerent orders (Lee and Lemieux, 2010):

log(yi) = δ0 + ρ I(xi,t ≥ xt

∗) + δ1f (xi,t − xt

∗) + δ2f (xi,t − xt

∗) ∗ I(xi,t ≥ xt

∗) + i

(1)

where log(yi) is the natural log of the adjusted annual income20 of individuals that have 1
to 15 years of potential experience on the labor market. I(xi,t ≥ xt
∗) is a dummy equal

to one if the running variable xi,t (the composite admission score) is above the admission

dummy, included to allow the slopes of the polynomial functions to be ﬂexible below and

above the threshold. In this sharp discontinuity context ˆρ is the estimate of the admission

eﬀect on income. This estimate can be seen as an “intent to treat eﬀect” since not every

20Since income is observed for the year 2005 for cohorts of students graduating from high school between
1985 and 2005, I regress individual log income on cohort ﬁxed eﬀects and retrieve the residuals. This allows
me to make a more fair comparison of income across cohorts.

admitted student actually enrolls in the elite university.

When interpreting the running variable xi,t in this setting, it is important to keep in mind

that the measurement unit of the standardized admission score (standard deviations) refer

to the admission composite score which is calculated only for the sub-sample of individuals

applying to the elite university. Figure 3 shows the distribution of high school exit scores for

students applying to the elite university and those that did not apply and do not take the

admission test. The distribution for students applying to the elite university is substantially

shifted to the right (mean is 0.4 high school exit score standard deviations higher) and has

lower variance. The sub-sample of students on which my RD analysis is run is thus already

very homogenous and positively selected with one standard deviation in the admission com-

posite score representing only a relatively small diﬀerence in the quality of the students with

respect to a standard deviation of the high school exit score.

In order to estimate the enrollment eﬀect on income, I use a fuzzy regression discontinuity

approach: I estimate the discontinuity in the probability of enrolling at the elite university

and use it to re-scale the discontinuity in income estimated in Speciﬁcation (1).21 I implement

a two-stage least square approach in which I estimate the predicted probability of enrolling
at the elite university (cid:92)p(enrolledi = 1) with the following ﬁrst stage regression:

p(Enrolledi = 1) = θ0 +πI(xi,t ≥ xt

∗)+θ1f (xi,t−xt

∗)+θ2f (xi,t−xt

∗)∗ I(xi,t ≥ xt

∗)+ηi (2)

in which p(Enrolledi = 1) is a dummy equal to 1 if the student is observed enrolling at the

elite university and ˆπ is the estimate of the discontinuity in the probability of enrollment at

the threshold. All other right hand side variables are as in Speciﬁcation (1).

We can think of the eﬀect of enrolling at the elite university as the estimate ˆτ of the fol-

One can easily show that the enrollment eﬀect ˆτ is the result of re-scaling the discontinuity in

income ˆρ by the discontinuity in the enrollment probability ˆπ: replacing (2) into (3) indeed

leads to τ π = ρ and thus τ = ρ

π . In Section 5 I present estimates for ˆπ, ˆρ and ˆτ .

Due to the absence of precise admission data for the cohorts applying to the elite univer-

sity between 1985 and 1994 and the fact that I only have tax returns data for the year 2005,

I can perform regression discontinuity estimation with complete admission information and

income for the sample of cohorts applying to the elite university between 1995 and 2001.

Figure B1 illustrates the time line of the data. The main set of results presents estimates of

the returns to admission, enrollment at the elite university using this sub-sample of younger

cohorts.

A second identiﬁcation strategy allows me to exploit also the information for the full

sample. For cohorts applying to the elite university between 1985 and 1994 (as well as for

1995-2005), the high school exit score (which determines the composite admission score for

50%) is available from the high school dataset. Moreover, I have data on enrollment and

graduation at the elite university for all cohorts. I exploit a numerical simulation method

and the richness of my data to estimate the missing pieces of admission information.

I

present a formal model for this numerical simulation in the Technical Appendix A, but I

summarize the intuition here. I pool all cohorts that applied to college between 1985 and

2001 together and use pre-college characteristics and the subsample of younger cohorts with

complete information to predict the missing pieces of information for the older cohorts. These

raises two issues. One derives from the fact that I observe students that applied to the elite

university only if they enrolled after being admitted. I thus need to identify the applicants in

my sample who did not enroll into the elite university (i.e. applicants who were not admitted

14

and applicants who were admitted but did not enroll). To do so I run a probit model with the

probability of applying to the elite university conditional on not enrolling on the left hand

side and a wide range of pre-college high school and background variables on the right hand

side for the ten post-1994 applying cohorts for which I have complete admission information.

I then perform an out-of-sample prediction (conditional on pre-college characteristics) and

assign predicted probabilities of applying at the elite university conditional on not enrolling

to cohorts graduating from high school before 1994.

I also estimate the proportion α of

students in my post-1994 sample who apply to the elite university and do not enroll in each

year. The second issue is the absence of the exact admission composite score for the elder

cohorts. As mentioned earlier, the missing admission composite score is determined by an

equally weighted average of the university-speciﬁc admission test and the high school exit

score, which is available for all cohorts. I thus use only the high school exit score as a running

variable for the elder cohorts.22 Moreover, I do not know the minimum admission score for

these cohorts. For each admission session for which I do not observe the admission outcome,

I run the following OLS regression for each of k possible thresholds xt,k

22I have run also a more complex simulation in which I predict the score for the university-speciﬁc admission
test that is missing for elder cohorts using the estimates of the predicted score for younger cohorts for which
I have complete admission information. I then estimate the predicted admission test score out of sample
for elder cohorts based on a large set of background characteristics. Finally, I use the imputed admission
test together with the observed high school exit score to recreate the missing composite score for admission.
Results obtained with this second simulation are available upon request.

cohorts in my sample. In this numerical simulation, I ﬁrst sample ˆα ∗ Cohort size students

using the out of sample predicted probabilities of applying to the elite university (conditional

on not enrolling) as weights. This forms my control group. Next, I combine the predicted

control group with the observed treatment group (students observed enrolling at the elite

university) and estimate the threshold using equation (4) separately for each admission

session before 1995. Finally, I pool the cohorts together and run the regression discontinuity

estimation of equation (3) for the probability of enrollment.

4 Validity of the design

The main identiﬁcation assumption for my empirical strategy is that assignment around the

threshold that determines treatment is locally random (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). Before

presenting my results, I test the validity of this assumption in several ways. The local

randomness condition may be violated if the probability of treatment (i.e. the probability of

admission at the elite university) around the threshold depends on observable or unobservable

characteristics that are correlated with the outcomes under study. In this context, this would

manifest in the manipulation of admission outcomes around the threshold by individuals with

speciﬁc characteristics (e.g. if students with better potential outcomes can actively target a

score right above the admission threshold). In the institutional setting under analysis, given

the ﬁxed number of admitted students, the purely objective admission procedure (i.e. no

recommendation letters and no soft skill evaluations) and the idiosyncratic variation in ability

of each year’s applying cohort, it is extremely hard for students as well as for the admission

oﬃce to predict the cutoﬀ score for admission. However, if there were any manipulation,

16

we would observe a discontinuity in the density of applicants at the admission threshold

(McCrary, 2008). Figure 4 shows that the density of applicants is continuous through the

threshold. This is reassuring evidence that scores were not manipulated. Panel A includes

data for all years of admission in the data, including the post-year-1999 admissions that

were determined at a degree-speciﬁc level. As explained in section 2.2, I have re-scaled each

degree-speciﬁc threshold to be 0, so that for admission years after 1999 there are several

cutoﬀ scores per year and the running variable as to be interpreted as standard deviations

from each degree-speciﬁc threshold. As a result of this, for years 2000 and over the number

of individuals in Panel A the density appears a little higher around the cutoﬀs (on both

sides) then away from it. However, the smoothness of the density across the threshold (what

matters for the test) is preserved.

In panel B of Figure 4, I restrict the density test to

admission years before 2000 for which there was a single admission cutoﬀ score for the entire

university and show that the density behaves regularly also away from the threshold.

A second test of local random assignment to the treatment veriﬁes that pre-treatment

characteristics are smooth across the threshold. This is analogous to a test for balance

of background characteristics in an experimental study. Table 3 and the corresponding

Figure 5 show that this “smoothness” condition is veriﬁed for several relevant background

characteristics. Estimates are obtained with a parametric sharp discontinuity speciﬁcation

with ﬂexible linear polynomial as presented in Section 3, Speciﬁcation (1). Standard errors

are clustered at cohort-high school level.24 The ﬁrst outcome is a pre-college proxy for

family wealth, average house value in the city block where students lived at time of high

school attendance. The estimate of the discontinuity coeﬃcient is not signiﬁcant and small

in magnitude (0.045 with respect to an average logarithmic house value of 8 and a standard

deviation of 0.33). In Column 2, I focus on high school background characteristics. I ranked

the high school institutions present in my sample according to an index of the average

performance of students on the high school exit exam. The index varies between zero and

24A cluster corresponds to a group of same-cohort students graduating in a given year from one of the

high schools in the sample.

17

one. The results show that the quality of the high school attended by the students applying

to the elite university is smooth across the admission threshold. In Column 3, I repeat the

same exercise using a proxy for the average wealth of parents by school (i.e. the average

house value of students at the school). This is an important check for my design, because

it shows that students coming from the most selective high schools in Milan have the same

probability of being admitted close to the threshold as other students. It also indicates that

the admission procedure is based on objective scores and that there is no informal admission

channel, nor extra weight given to students coming from elite high schools. In Column 4, I

use a diﬀerent background measure that takes into account high school peers’ characteristics

and social economic status, the geographical concentration of high school classmates based

on an Herﬁndhal Index. This index is calculated on the neighborhood where the high school

students used to live at the time of high school attendance. The more students in the high

school class live in same neighborhoods, the higher the class geographical concentration

index. Data show that geographically concentrated high school classes are substantially

more common in high schools situated in less aﬄuent neighborhoods of the city. While the

best high schools attract the highest performing kids from all neighborhoods in the city,

periphery schools only attract a local pool of students.25 This type of geographical selection

into high schools is the reason why students in these geographically concentrated classes also

have substantially lower scores on the high school exit exam relative to students of other

schools. On the one hand, this index can be seen as a proxy for low socio-economic status and

academic performance. On the other hand, students in classes that are more geographically

concentrated are more likely to interact also after school (since all students live in the same

neighborhood) and to have tighter network. If we are concerned that some students have

information that allows them to target the admission threshold, it is more likely that this

information is shared in these geographically concentrated classes. If this hypothesis were

true, we should observe a larger mass of students with a higher Herﬁndhal Index just right

25There is no geographical restriction to high school attendance in Italy.

of the admission threshold. However, also this background characteristic is continuous at

the admission threshold.

In Appendix Table B1, I show that results of Table 3 are robust to smaller bandwidths and

hold for other background characteristics. In Table B2, I repeat the same test of smoothness

using the high school curriculum26 of the students and their gender. The coeﬃcient of interest

remains insigniﬁcant. A remaining threat to my regression discontinuity is selection of the

tax records. If students right below admission threshold are less likely to be matched to tax

returns records, my estimates may be biased. As Column 3 of Table B2 shows, this is not

the case. I also show that the probability of observing income exactly equal to zero in the

tax returns is continuous across the threshold.

5 Results

Table 4 and Figure 6 present my main estimates for the returns to elite college attendance for

the sample of cohorts applying to the elite university between 1995 and 2001 (the cohorts for

which I have complete admission data). Standard errors are clustered at cohort/high-school

level. Columns 1 and 2 present estimates of the parameters as described in Section 3 with a
linear and a quadratic polynomial respectively, restricting estimation to a bandwidth of ±3

standard deviations of the composite admission score around the threshold.27 The sample of

students on which my RD analysis is run, the sub-sample who take the test for admission at

the elite university, is very homogenous and positively selected (as shown in Figure 3) with

one standard deviation in the admission composite score representing only a relatively small

diﬀerence in the ability of the students with respect to a standard deviation of the high school

exit score. The ﬁrst row of the table shows the sharp discontinuity estimate in income at

26College preparatory high schools in my sample oﬀer either a curriculum in classical studies or one in

scientiﬁc studies.

27All speciﬁcations in Table 4 include gender and the family wealth proxy (parents’ house value) as controls.
As standard robustness check for regression discontinuity estimates I replicate results of Table 4 excluding
control variables in Appendix Table B3. Results remain unchanged. As in a fully experimental estimations
including background controls should increase the total variance explained by the model, but should not
change the estimates of the treatment.

the admission threshold, which represents the admission eﬀect. Given that not all admitted

students decide to enroll in the elite university, we can consider this estimate as an “intent to

treat” eﬀect. The eﬀect is sizeable, around 41 logarithmic points.28 The second and the third

row present the fuzzy discontinuity estimates for the eﬀect of enrolling at the elite university.

Enrollment eﬀects (second row of Table 4) are larger then the admission eﬀect, around 52

logarithmic points. The bottom panel of Table 4 shows the estimated discontinuities in the

probability of enrolling. These are the ﬁrst stage estimates used to re-scale the admission

eﬀect to obtain enrollment eﬀect in the “Wald-estimate” setting described in Section 3.

Figure 6A shows graphical representation of the estimated discontinuity in income of Table

4, Column 1. While the downward sloping linear ﬁt to the left of the threshold might seem

counter-intuitive, a deeper look at the data clariﬁes why this happens. Although the share

of “high-S.E.S.” students is quite ﬂat along the distribution of the admission score to the

right of the threshold, it is increasing to the left of the threshold and spikes up on the left

tail of the distribution. Among the lowest performing students, there is a wide majority of

students from very wealthy families. The income for these students might thus be correlated

with their social background relatively more than to school performance.29 Moreover, the

negative slope coeﬃcient left of the threshold is not statistically signiﬁcant.

When estimating the discontinuity using the quadratic polynomial speciﬁcation in Col-

umn 2 of Table 4, the magnitude of the coeﬃcients tend to increase. Although the estimates

are not statistically diﬀerent across the two speciﬁcations, Figure 6B gives some guidance

on why the estimates for the quadratic polynomial tend to be larger. By examining the

ﬁgure it appears that the quadratic parametric interpolation for the control group (i.e. the

non-admitted student) is driven by the outliers at the very bottom of the admission score

28Under the semi-logarithmic speciﬁcation the eﬀects measured are a good approximation of the eﬀect in
percentage change as long as the eﬀects are close to 0. To be more precise, the estimate ˆτ in percentage
change must be transformed as follow: eˆτ − 1. In this case the percentage change correspondent to the 41
logarithm point change is 50%

29In other words, while low S.E.S. students do not apply and do not even take the elite university admission
test unless they know they have a substantial chance to be admitted, high S.E.S. students apply and take
the test even if they have very small chances of admission.

distribution furthest from the threshold.30 In Columns 3 and 4, I test the robustness of my
results by restricting the estimation to smaller bandwidths (±2 and ±1 standard deviations

around the admission threshold). In Column 3, the results are similar in magnitude to those

of Column 1, while for an even smaller bandwidth the estimates tend to be larger. Although

I am careful in interpreting the coeﬃcients of estimates obtained with smaller bandwidths
given the relatively small sample size (especially the speciﬁcation with the ±1 bandwidth

is very demanding), it is clear that estimates for returns to elite college attendance remain

sizeable even in the most demanding speciﬁcations.

As a robustness check, I have replicated the estimation using data-driven bandwidth

selection methods and non-parametric, bias-corrected RD estimators as proposed by Calonico

et al. (2014a, 2014b). All estimates are consistent in sign and signiﬁcance with the ones

found in Table 4 using parametric estimation, but are in all speciﬁcation slightly larger in

magnitude. This suggests that the enrollment eﬀect (around 52 logarithmic points as in

second row of Table 4) might represent a lower bound for the income premium generated

by attending the elite university. Results for the estimates based on Calonico et al. (2014a,

2014b) are available upon request.

In Figure 7 I test whether my results are truly capturing a causal discontinuity in income

at the admission threshold or they are instead result of an idiosyncratic jump in income that

happens close to the admission cutoﬀ score. I plot the estimated discontinuity ˆρ at the true

cutoﬀ score and at other placebo cutoﬀ scores 0.1 or more standard deviations away from

the true cutoﬀ. Whiskers represent precision of each estimate. Panels A-D reﬂect the same

4 speciﬁcations as in Table 4 and Figure 6. These ﬁgures conﬁrm that the only signiﬁcant

income discontinuity present in the data is at the true threshold reassuring on the causal

interpretation of the estimated returns to admission at the elite university.

30These outliers are the consequence of the “thin” left tail in the admission score distribution.

21

6 Discussion

In this section, I discuss my results in the context of the literature, present a robustness

check, study whether the eﬀects are heterogenous across the income distribution and explore

potential mechanisms. I also use a simple cost-beneﬁt analysis to provide an estimate for

the cumulative discounted net returns to elite college education.

As shown in Table 4, I estimate sizeable returns to admission and enrollment at the elite

university (respectively 40 and 52%). These returns are marginally smaller in magnitude

than the average returns to college graduation with respect to high school, which are between

45% and 75% according to diﬀerent causal estimates from the literature (see Oreopoulos and

Petronijevic, 2013 for a review of these estimates). In distributional terms the estimated

52% premium is equivalent to a jump from the 44th percentile of Italy’s national income

distribution to the 74th percentile. The U.S.-distribution-equivalent yearly income premium

is $19,952 ($43,838 for graduates of the elite university vs. $23,886 for the other graduates).

For comparison, the estimated $19,952 premium to attending elite education amounts to

roughly 65% of the U.S. College/high school premium ($29,125), as calculated by Autor

(2014).

When compared to other studies that estimate returns to college education quality, my

estimates are among the largest. Hoekstra (2009) ﬁnds that U.S. students attending a

ﬂagship state university earn 24% more than those who attend non-ﬂagship state universities,

while Brewer et al. (1999) estimate a 40% earning premium to attending an elite private

institution relative to attending a low quality public college. When interpreting my results,

it is important to take into account the institutional context. In terms of selectiveness and

outcomes, the diﬀerence between the elite university and the other universities under analysis

is comparable to the case of U.S. private elite college versus public or community colleges (see

Section 2.1). In addition, the education “quality treatment” is more intense in my setting

than in the context of a ﬂagship institution in a homogenous college public system.31 The

31While the median graduate of the elite university under analysis is placed in the income distribution

22

other institutional feature that may inﬂuence the size of the estimated returns is the choice

of major. As I will discuss in Section 6.3 students’ preferences for institutions and majors32

are not lexicographic and just-below-threshold students are substantially less likely to major

in Economics and Business with respect to just-above-threshold ones.

From a policy perspective, it is interesting to compare my quasi-experimental estimates

of the returns to elite college education with the unconditional diﬀerence in mean income

across universities. The average income of students attending the elite university are 87%

higher than those of students attending less selective universities in Milan. Comparing this

to the 52% income premium estimated with the regression discontinuity implies that about

40% of the unconditional mean premium is due to selection. This suggests that producing

rankings based on graduates’ average income would substantially overestimate the value

added of attending elite universities.

6.1 Extending estimation to older cohorts

Results are signiﬁcant and robust to diﬀerent speciﬁcations. However, the small sample size

may raise some concerns about the credibility of my estimates. I thus extend my analysis

to those cohorts applying to the elite university between 1985 and 1994 for which I observe

only a partial component of the admission score, by exploiting an alternative identiﬁcation

strategy as presented in Section 3 and described more in detail in the Technical Appendix

A. Including older cohorts in the analysis has two main advantages. First, it substantially

increases the number of observations. Second, it allows me to extend estimation of returns

to individuals who are 6 to 15 years passed graduation instead of focusing on the ﬁrst 5

years on the labor market only.33 In Table 5 I report the estimate obtained by extending the

similarly to graduates of Duke University and Carnagie Mellon, the median graduate of all other Milan
universities is placed much further down in the income distribution at levels comparable to lower-ranked col-
leges in the same states of Duke University and Carnagie Mellon (respectively, Durham Technical Community
College and the Community College of Philadelphia)

32In the European context students apply for speciﬁc majors in speciﬁc universities and each university

oﬀers a limited bundle of majors.

33When exploring returns over the experience proﬁle, it is important to keep in mind that I am not able
to properly disentangle the eﬀect of labor market experience from cohort eﬀects since I observe income for

23

estimation to the older cohorts. Column 1 of Table 5 include the preferred estimate obtained

with the sample of younger cohorts for which I have complete admission information (as from

Table 4). Column 2 estimates the eﬀect of enrolling in the elite university using all cohorts

available and the numerical bootstrapping procedure explained in the Technical Appendix

A. The estimates are extremely similar in magnitude, while the standard errors drop by

50%.34 This exercise reassures me on the validity of the estimates obtained with the smaller

sample and provides an estimate of the returns to enrollment in the elite university also for

the elder cohorts.

6.2 “Lottery-ticket Eﬀect”

In this section, I explore the possibility that elite college attendance aﬀects income heteroge-

neously over the income distribution. In particular, I investigate whether attending the elite

university increases the probability of reaching the top of the income distribution.35 Figure

8 sheds light on this question. I estimate the eﬀects of enrolling at the elite university on the

probability of being in the qth quantile of the income distribution. Each dot in the graph rep-

resents a diﬀerent speciﬁcation in which the left-hand-side is a dummy variable that takes on

value one if the income observed from tax returns is above or equal to the qth quantile of the

income distribution. Whiskers represent precision of estimates. The ﬁgure shows that the

discontinuity is stronger (around 11 percentage points) for the probability of having income

between the 70th and the 80th quantile of the income distribution. We can interpret this as

evidence of a lottery-ticket eﬀect that allows students right above the admission threshold

to reach the top quartile of the income distribution. On the other hand, this exercise shows

that no “insurance eﬀect” is present (there is no discontinuity in the probability of being in

year 2005 only. Therefore, I can analyze returns by years since graduation only under the assumption that
returns to experience are constant across cohorts

34By increasing the sample size three times, precision doubles. This is the result of a trade-oﬀ for which
I improve precision by increasing the sample size, while reducing it because of measurement error while
estimating the unknown threshold for elder cohorts as described in Section 3.

35A recent working paper by Zimmermann (2015) explores a similar channel, estimating the eﬀect of elite

college admission on students chances of reaching top management positions

24

the bottom quartile of the income distribution at the admission threshold)

6.3 Mechanisms

The estimates in Table 4 are large and represent the reduced form estimates of the labor

markets returns to attendance at the elite university under study. However, what are the po-

tential mechanisms through which admission to the elite university yields such large returns?

In this section, I take advantage of the richness of my dataset to explore how admission to

the elite university aﬀects academic decisions and performance. As summarized by Figure 9,

the mechanisms I explore in my analysis are college completion, time to graduation, choice

of major and peer composition. However, other relevant mechanisms such as signaling and

human capital are not easy to analyze empirically with my data and are thus not discussed

in this work.

In Table 6 and the relative Figure 10, I explore the presence of discontinuities at the

admission threshold for four academic outcomes of interest.36

I show estimates for the

baseline parametric speciﬁcation with linear ﬂexible polynomials and with a bandwidth of
±3 standard deviations around the admission threshold (as for the main results Table 4

Column 1). In Column 1 I focus on the probability of graduating from college. Students that

were just above the admission threshold were 13.6 percentage points more likely to graduate

than just-below threshold ones, with respect to a 73% baseline probability of graduation.

Admission to the elite university may have an impact also on the time students take to

complete a degree. Tuition fees at the elite university are three times higher than for the

other universities. This might constitute a strong incentive to avoid delaying graduation or

an incentive to perform better and obtain higher returns.37 In Table 6, Column 2, I thus

check the presence of a discontinuity in “time to graduation”.38 The estimate shows that

36In Appendix Table B4, I show that results of Table 6 are robust to smaller bandwidths.
37Garibaldi, Giavazzi, Ichino, Rettore (2012), using a Regression Discontinuity Design, ﬁnd that an increase
of 1,000 euro in tuition fees reduces the probability of late graduation by at least 6.1 percentage points with
respect to a benchmark average probability of 80%

38Since I cannot observe time to graduation for college dropout students, I have imputed as time to

25

just-above threshold students take 6 fewer months to graduate than just-below threshold

ones. College completion and time to graduation appear to be an important channel in

explaining the returns to attending the elite university. Although I cannot make causal

statements on why the elite university substantially increases probability of graduation and

reduce time to degree, there must be some characteristics of the elite university educational

environment that determine these outcomes. The elite university may have better incentives

in place to encourage students to complete their college education and to complete it earlier.

A more intense instructor-student interaction or a more rewarding learning experience might

play a role. Looking back at Table 1 might shed some light on the institutional features that

might aﬀect these academic outcomes. The level of expenditures per student are clearly

higher (93% higher) in the elite university, however only a small fraction of these higher

expenditures appear to be invested in better-paid and thus better-quality faculty (the elite

university pays only 13% more per faculty member than other universities). The other

dimensions on which the elite university invests substantially more than the other universities

in Milan are infrastructures (e.g. buildings, computers, labs, student spaces, etc.), services

to students (e.g. career service, international exchange programs, etc.) and services to

faculty (e.g. administration, teaching and research assistants, etc.). These dimensions might

all contribute to increase the probability of completing college and reducing time to degree.

Another important factor that goes beyond teaching quality and infrastructures is the quality

of peers. In Column 3 I estimate a discontinuity in the average quality of peers (deﬁned as

students in one’s cohort who enroll in same university and program). Estimates show that

just-above threshold students are exposed to peers that had substantially higher (more than

a standard deviation higher) score in the high school exit exam. Exposure to higher-skilled,

more motivated student peers might thus play a crucial role in explaining the improved

academic performance for just-above-threshold students at the elite university.

Although it remains challenging to identify the speciﬁc institutional features that posi-

graduation the maximum time to graduation in my data after excluding outliers (more than three standard
deviations away from the mean).

26

tively aﬀect these academic outcomes, higher and faster college graduation, and exposure to

higher skilled peers are clearly relevant features to factor in the bundled “value added” of

attending this elite university.

In Column 4 of Table 6, I test weather the choice of major is one of the relevant mech-

anisms in explaining the estimated returns to elite college attendance. More speciﬁcally,

I focus on the probability of choosing an Economics or Business major as outcome in my

speciﬁcation. The elite university oﬀers a broad range of courses, but all formally listed

under the faculty of Business and Economics, which may lead admitted students to major

in this ﬁeld more than others. Column 4 of Table 6 shows that students with a score just

below the admission threshold are 33 percentage points less likely to major in Business or

Economics. Figure 10 shows this graphically. In Figure B3 I show which majors students not

admitted at the elite university chose. Only 58% of them major Business and Economics,

while the remaining 42% majored in Law (16%), Humanities (5%), Engineering (4%), Social

Sciences (4%) or other majors. This reveals the interesting fact that preferences of students

for university and majors are not lexicographic: students do not rank institutions by speciﬁc

chosen major or choose major conditional on university as it naturally happens in the U.S.

context. On the contrary, they rank a bundle of institution and major choices.

Baseline diﬀerences in income by major are large and the discontinuity in Column 4 of

Table 6 shows that admission to the elite university substantially increases the probability

to choose a degree in economics and business. The choice of major is clearly an important

mechanism in determining the returns to attending the elite university under study. One

might be tempted to run the baseline regression discontinuity speciﬁcation on income by

restricting the analysis to students (both admitted and not admitted) who major in eco-

nomics and business to get an estimate of the returns to elite college attendance for students

graduating in the same major. However, in this context the choice of major is an outcome

of the admission process (as shown clearly by the discontinuity in the choice of major at

the cutoﬀ) and the very heterogenous selection into diﬀerent majors shown in Figure B3 for

27

students that were just below the admission threshold is clearly endogenous. Restricting the

analysis to students who choose Economics and Business or including ﬁxed eﬀects for major

choice in this context would lead to the same selection issues arising when controlling for an

outcome in a standard regression setting.39 Therefore, I follow an alternative “back of the

envelope” method to disentangle the eﬀect of attending the elite university from the eﬀect of

choice of major. I exploit the sample of younger cohorts not included in the main regression

discontinuity analysis (and thus “exogenous” to the estimated quasi-experimental estimates

of returns to elite college attendance) to estimate returns to major choice, net of the eﬀect of

university. I do so by using a mincerian speciﬁcation in which I include dummies for choice

of major (omitting Economics and Business) and university dummies. Column 1 of Table 7

shows returns to choice of majors relative to returns to choosing Economics and Business.

In column 2 I instead report the share of students in the regression discontinuity sample (i.e.

later cohorts for which I have estimated the quasi-experimental estimates of returns to elite

college education) that I observe choosing each major (other than Economics and Business)

after missing admission to the elite university. In column 3 I calculate the average expected

returns to choosing majors other than Economics and Business (weighted for the observe

shares of students choosing each alternative major) for the sample of students that were just

below threshold for admission to the elite university. This exercise relies on two important

caveats: average returns to major are the same for earlier and older cohorts and baseline

returns to choosing Economics and Business (net of the university speciﬁc eﬀect) are the

same for students admitted to the elite university and those that were not admitted.40

I

estimate an average weighted return to choosing majors other than Business and Economics

of -0.19% for my speciﬁc sample of not-admitted students. Keeping in mind the important

caveats mentioned above, we can disentangle the 52% estimated eﬀect for enrolling in the

elite university, by attributing a 19% eﬀect to the diﬀerent choices of major made by not-

39See “bad controls”, Angrist and Pischke 2009
40This latter caveat conceptually reﬂects the baseline regression discontinuity assumption for students who

are in a close interval around the admission threshold.

28

admitted students and by interpreting the remaining 33% as the residual institutional eﬀect

of enrolling at the elite university, net of the major choice. Such an estimate is close to (still

slightly larger) those estimated by previous literature in similar contexts (i.e. Hoekstra,

2009).

Besides the more academic mechanisms analysed in this section, an array of other quality

components aﬀecting income remain unexplored in this work. Institutional reputation and

signaling may inﬂuence individual income, especially in the ﬁrst years on the labor market.

Peer eﬀects may also be relevant for the labor market outcomes. As shown in the descriptive

statistics, just-above-threshold students are exposed to peers that have substantially higher

academic performance and come from relatively wealthier and more educated families. This

may aﬀect the type of networks available to the just-above-threshold students before and

after graduation.

6.4 Net discounted returns

While the annual income premium of attending the elite university is large and signiﬁcant,

it is interesting to evaluate the net returns after taking into account the substantially higher

tuition fees. In Table 8 I present a “cost-beneﬁt” calculation that takes into account expected

net yearly tuition, expected time to graduation and a baseline 3% discount rate to translate

the estimated annual income premium to the net returns to investment. The calculation is

based on the income premium estimated on all cohorts available for the ﬁrst 15 years after

graduation (Table 5) and on the discontinuity in time to graduation as estimated in Table 6.

Table 8 shows that the cumulative discounted net returns to enrolling at the elite university

measured 15 years after graduation are equal to $119,389 (EUR 108,535). Alternatively,

this means that the net returns to enrolling in the elite university are positive already in

the 3rd year after graduation. By repeating the same exercise using the “pure” institutional

estimate (after taking into account the eﬀect of the choice of major) presented in Section

6.3, the net returns to attending the elite university 15 years after graduation are $71,729

29

and turn positive in the 4th year after graduation.

7 Conclusions

I exploit a newly collected administrative Italian dataset following students from high school

through college and into labor market, to estimate returns to enrolling at an elite uni-

versity in the city of Milan. The administrative dataset has been matched to individual

records from the admission oﬃce of the elite university under analysis.

I take advantage

of a sharp discontinuity in the probability of admission at the admission score threshold to

obtain quasi-experimental estimates of returns to enrollment. This regression discontinuity

approach allows me to overcome concerns of selection bias due to students selecting into elite

universities based on unobservable characteristics correlated with potential income.

I estimate a 52% annual income premium for students enrolling at the elite university

under analysis.

In distributional terms, this premium is equivalent to a shift from the

44th percentile of Italy’s national income distribution to the 74th percentile. The U.S.-

distribution-equivalent yearly income premium would be $19,952 ($43,838 for graduates of

the elite university vs. $23,886 for the other graduates). This premium amounts to roughly

65% of the $29,125 U.S. College/high school premium, as estimated by Autor (2014).

I explore the mechanisms underlying such a large eﬀect. I ﬁnd that students obtaining

an admission score just above the admission threshold are more likely to complete a college

degree and take six fewer months to graduate. I also estimate a large discontinuity in the

choice of major. Just-above threshold students are 30 percentage points more likely to

choose economics or business as their major. This suggests that preferences of students

for institutions and majors are not lexicographic. Students do not rank institutions after

choosing a speciﬁc major, but make bundled “institution/major” enrollment decisions.

I

show that, net of the major choice, the residual institutional quality eﬀect of attending the

elite university is 33%. This estimate is in line with those previously estimated by other

30

papers in similar contexts.

I explore how attending the elite university aﬀects income across the income distribution

and ﬁnd evidence of a signiﬁcant “lottery-ticket eﬀect”. Just-above threshold students have

higher probability to have income in the top quartile of the national income distribution.

On the other hand, they are not signiﬁcantly less likely to end up in the bottom quartile of

the income distribution.

Breaking down the eﬀect of college quality on income into single quality components is a

complex task. The estimates I obtain must be interpreted as the eﬀect of the “bundled” qual-

ity of the elite university. This includes multiple educational inputs such as faculty, research

and organization, and also the eﬀect of signaling, reputation and peer eﬀects. Interestingly,

the discontinuity in enrollment determines a radical change in the average characteristics of

college peers. The evidence I ﬁnd of a discontinuous increase in the probability of completing

college for just-above-threshold students suggests that the educational environment of the

elite university may motivate students more, ceteris paribus. Competitive and motivated

peers or more eﬀective teachers might play a role in this.

I also present a cost-beneﬁt analysis that takes into account yearly tuition, average time

to graduation and a discount rate to translate the estimated annual income premium to

discounted net returns to investment. The estimate shows that cumulative net returns to

attending the elite university measured 15 years after graduation (the span of income data

for my sample) are equal to $120,000 (EUR 108,535).

Finally, approximately 40% of the observed unconditional diﬀerence in mean income

across universities is due to selection. In a policy perspective, this suggests that ranking

institutions according to graduates’ average income would substantially overestimate the

value added of attending elite universities.

A Technical Appendix - Numerical simulation for ex-

tending estimation to older cohorts

As explained in Section 3, data from admission oﬃce of the elite university have been matched

only for cohorts of students in my sample who graduated from high school between 1995 and

2005. For the cohorts of students graduating from high school between 1985 and 1994 I

know only partial admission information: I know which university they attended, their high

school exit score (that determines admission score with a weight of 50%), while I miss the

score obtained in the elite university admission test. Moreover I do not know which students

applied to the elite university but were not admitted.

In this appendix I describe the numerical simulation method used to combine partial

information for older cohorts with the complete data available for earlier cohorts to produce

estimates of returns to elite education for the full sample of cohorts graduating from high

school between 1985 and 2001. Since income is available for year 2005 only, pooling all

cohorts together not only substantially increases the number of observations, but also allows

to estimates returns for individuals that have spent up to 15 years on the labor market after

graduation.

Numerical simulation

Let i be the index for one of the 30,000 individuals in my sample graduating from high
t (1985(cid:54) t (cid:54) 2005) represents the year of high

school in Milan between 1985 and 2005.

school graduation for individual i and also the year in which i takes university admission

tests.

For each individual i I deﬁne four diﬀerent statuses deﬁning her/his relationship with the

elite university under study:

Appliedi: Indicator=1 if student i is observed applying to the elite university

Admittedi: Indicator=1 if student i is admitted at the elite university

54

Enrolledi: Indicator=1 if student i is observed enrolling in the elite university

Graduatedi: Indicator=1 if student i is observed graduating from elite university

Following the dataset structure I categorize individuals in ﬁve types:

1. Type 0000: (Appliedi=0; Admittedi=0; Enrolledi = 0; Graduatedi = 0) students

graduating from one of the high schools sampled in the data who did not apply at the

elite university and hence did not take the test.

2. Type 1000: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=0; Enrolledi = 0; Graduatedi = 0) students

applying at the elite university, but failed the test.

3. Type 1100: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=1; Enrolledi = 0; Graduatedi = 0) students

applying at the elite university who passed the test, but decided to enroll in a diﬀerent

university.

4. Type 1110: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=1; Enrolledi = 1; Graduatedi = 0) students

applying at the elite university who passed the test, enrolled at the elite university,

but dropped out from elite university.

5. Type 1111: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=1; Enrolledi = 1; Graduatedi = 1) students

graduating from elite university.

The variables involved in the numerical simulation are deﬁned as follows:

yi: Logarithm of annual income observed in year 2005 for individual i

xhsi,t: High school exit score for individual i completing high school in year t (observed for

all cohorts in the sample)

xu

i,t: Elite university admission test score for individual i in admission session of year t

(observed for individuals applying to elite university after 1994, Appliedi=1)

xi,t = 1

2xhsi,t + 1

admission (observed for individuals applying to elite university after 1994, Appliedi=1)

55

∗: Admission threshold for admission session of year t such that individual i is admitted
xt

∗

For individuals i graduating in 1995≤ t ≤ 2005 all above variables are available.

For individuals i graduating in 1985≤ t <1995 I still observe xhsi,t, Enrolledi = 1,

Graduatedi = 1 and yi, but the following variables are missing: Appliedi, Admittedi, xu

i,t,

∗

xi,t, xt

The empirical issues arising from the absence of these variables for the older cohorts can

be summarized as follows:

Missing variable problem 1: I observe Enrolledi, Graduatedi. I do not observe Admittedi =
0. I can infer I(Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 1) and I(Admittedi = 1|Enrolledi = 1). I need to
estimate I(Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0)
Estimation step 1 : estimate P(Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0, xh
i,t, Pre college characteris-
tics Zi,t) for 1995≤ t ≤ 2005 and predict them out of sample to older individuals grad-
uating from high school in 1985≤ t ≤ 1994. Use

P (Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0, xh

(cid:92)

i,t, Zi)

as individual weights to draw B = 100 times a sample of individuals predicted as apply-

ing to elite university conditional on observing them not enrolling in the elite university:
Ib( (cid:92)Appliedi,b = 1|Enrolledi,b = 0) with b being each of 100 repetitions in the simulation.
What follows is also repeated at each repetition, however I drop the subscript b to keep

notation simple.

Missing variable problem 2: I do not observe university admission test score xu

i,t and as

a consequence the admission composite score xi,t determined for 50% by the admission test

score

Estimation step 2 : I use high school exit score xhs

i,t (which determines 50% of the overall ad-

56

mission score) as running variable for running my regression discontinuity at each repetition

b.

Missing variable problem 3: I do not observe the admission threshold x∗

t

Estimation step 3 : I pool the individuals predicted as applied at the elite university con-
ditional on observing them not enrolling I( (cid:92)Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0) and those who are
observed enrolling Enrolledi = 1 for 1985≤ t ≤ 1994. For each t and for each possible

the probability of admission)

Once the control group of not admitted applicants to the elite university and admission

thresholds have been estimated for the older cohorts, at each repetition b I recombine the

data as follows. For cohorts graduating from high school after year t=1994 I keep the original

data with complete admission information. For older cohorts of students applying to elite

university between 1985 and 1994 I include individuals that have been observed enrolling at

the elite university as the treatment group and I take as the control group those individuals

predicted as not admitted applicants.

After pooling these three sub-smaples together at each repetition b of the numerical

simulation, I estimate my main regression discontinuity speciﬁcations:

At each repetition b I then store the estimate of the return to enrolling in the elite

The College Wage Premium
Jonathan James

The return on educational investments has risen substantially in the past 30 years. While the primary focus has been on 
the college wage premium, new evidence shows that the value of going to college is affected by a host of other impor-
tant educational decisions, each of which has a potentially large effect on future earnings. This Commentary examines 
the impact of two of these other decisions on earnings: the choice of a college major and the pursuit of an advanced 
degree. In some cases, differences in the college major premium are as large as the college wage premium itself.

It is well documented that college graduates earn signiﬁ cantly 
higher wages on average than those with only a high school 
diploma. The college wage premium has been a central 
focus for researchers because it is both large and growing. 
Current data indicate that college degree holders enjoy an 
84 percent increase in earnings over their high-school-
educated counterparts. 
Given this large disparity in earnings, some may argue that 
the greatest decision facing young people today is whether to 
go to (and complete) college. However, a growing literature 
has begun to suggest that the decision to go to college is just 
one of a sequence of educational investment decisions, each 
of which has a large effect on potential earnings. 
At the forefront of this literature is the choice of a college 
major. The availability of new data has highlighted the wide 
variation in wages across college majors, which in many 
cases is as large as the college wage premium itself. Addi-
tionally, advanced degrees yield a wage premium beyond 
what is awarded for a bachelor’s degree. This evidence 
implies that the gravity of the college decision is perhaps 
equally matched by the decisions one makes while in 
college as well as after college. 
This Commentary takes a more detailed look at the college 
wage premium, with a focus on how the premium is affected 
by these supplemental educational investment decisions. 
Two consequential decisions beside the college decision are 
discussed in particular: the choice of a college major and the 
pursuit of an advanced degree.

Trends in the College Wage Premium
The college wage premium is calculated as the ratio of the 
median hourly wage for those holding a bachelor’s degree 
and the median hourly wage for those who have only 
completed high school. This statistic for full-time workers is 
plotted in ﬁ gure 1. These data show that the college wage 
premium increased rapidly through the 1980s and early 
part of the 1990s, rising from 40 percent to upwards of 
70 percent. Since the late 1990s, the premium has experienced 
a much slower rate of growth, drifting at times below and 
above 80 percent. Importantly though, the premium has 
persisted at historically high levels through the 2000s, 
becoming an enduring feature of the U.S. wage structure.

Notes: Premiums are calculated as the ratio of median hourly wages for those 
holding a bachelor’s degree or those with some college and the median hourly 
wages for those who have only completed high school. Data include workers who 
worked full-time (35 hours or more) and for a full year (40 weeks or more).

Figure 1 also highlights the importance of college completion 
by showing the wage premium for those with only some 
college but lacking a four-year degree. The premium for 
these workers has experienced little to no growth over 
the last 30 years, where at the median they have about 
15 percent to 20 percent higher earnings.
Collectively, these results show that over the last three 
decades, the value of college has increased substantially, 
with all of the gains going to those who actually complete 
the four-degree.

Advanced Degree Premium
The standard assessment of the college wage premium is 
somewhat misleading because counted among four-year 
degree holders are those who also have an advanced 
degree. Including these individuals in the analysis may over-
state these returns, much in the same way that including high 
school dropouts in the high school graduate pool would. 
To study the inﬂ uence of including advanced degrees in the 
college premium calculation, ﬁ gure 2 plots the trend in the 
advanced degree premium, which is the ratio of median 
wages for those who hold a four-year degree and an advanced 
degree (6 plus years of college, a master’s degree, professional 
degree, or PhD) over those with only a bachelor’s degree. 
Looking from 1977 to the present, advanced degree earners 
have experienced growth in wages over and above those with 
only a four-year degree, from around 20 percent in the early 
1980s to around 30 percent today. 
To evaluate the effect of the four-year degree alone, 
advanced degree holders must be separated from the 
analysis. Figure 3 plots the wage premium for those with 
only a four-year degree and those who additionally have 
an advanced degree (both premiums are with respect to 
median wages of high school graduates). 

Even excluding advanced degree holders, the premium for 
a four-year degree alone remains extremely high at about 
60 percent. Interestingly, once the growth in wages for 
advanced degree holders is removed, the four-year degree 
premium has remained ﬂ at over the past decade. In other 
words, it is the growth in the value of advanced degrees that 
has accounted for all of the growth in the classical measure 
of the college wage premium since the 2000s.

Major Choice
Beginning in 2009 the American Community Survey (ACS), 
a large and nationally representative sample of the U.S. 
population, began collecting information on degree ﬁ eld 
for bachelor’s degree holders. Previous work studying the 
effect of the degree ﬁ eld on wages was conducted on much 
smaller samples and typically for only recent graduates. 
The availability of this information in the ACS has been an 
important resource because it yields high statistical power 
and is representative of the entire labor force.
The ACS separates four-year degree ﬁ elds into more than 
170 detailed categories. The detailed categories can be ag-
gregated into 15 broad categories to simplify the analysis. 
Using data from 2009 and 2010, ﬁ gure 4 plots the college 
four-year degree premium and the advanced degree premi-
um for each of these 15 aggregate categories. Figure 4 gives 
detail on the premiums as well as the proportion of four-
year degree holders in each ﬁ eld. The height of the brown 
bars shows the density of four-year degree holders in each 
area, and the height of the green bar shows the fraction in 
that major ﬁ eld who also hold an advanced degree. 
Figure 4 indicates that business (including economics) is 
by far the most popular ﬁ eld (since this is the bar with 
the largest height among the 15 categories). The largest 
fractions of advanced degree holders have BAs in either

education or business. However, this is due in large part to 
the fact that these two majors represent a signiﬁ cant share 
of the bachelor’s degree population. Perhaps more interest-
ing is to look at those ﬁ elds that have a high (or low) rate of 
advanced degree holding relative to their population. One 
example is biological and life science, where more than 
half of the four-year degree holders go on to receive an 
advanced degree. This is not surprising if this is the 
predominate undergraduate degree for medical doctors.
The college major choice has a potentially large effect on the 
value of a four-year degree. Comparing engineering majors, 
who have the highest four-year premium at 125 percent, to 
psychology and social work majors, who have the lowest 
premium at 40 percent, yields a difference in the college 
major premium of 85 percent, which is the same size as the 
traditional measure of the college wage premium.
Figure 5 breaks down the returns for the top 15 most popu-
lar detailed degree ﬁ elds. These ﬁ elds represent about 50 
percent of the degrees held by those with a bachelor’s 
degree. This chart shows again the large variance in returns 
by degree ﬁ eld as well as the large variation between simi-

larly deﬁ ned majors. For example, the aggregate category 
“business” from ﬁ gure 4 included degrees in business 
management and administration and ﬁ nance. Figure 5 
shows that ﬁ nance degree holders at the median have 
20 percent higher wages than those with a business 
management and administration degree. Of the 15 most 
popular majors, electrical engineering and computer 
science enjoy the highest premium for a four-year degree.
This evidence shows that the ﬁ eld of study has a large effect 
on potential earnings. Despite these large differences, it is 
important to acknowledge that at the median, there is a 
strong positive beneﬁ t for a four-year degree above a high 
school diploma, regardless of the degree ﬁ eld chosen.

Conclusion
Over the last three decades, the earnings of four-year degree 
holders have signiﬁ cantly outpaced the earnings of high 
school graduates and those with some college but lacking a 
college degree. The sharpest increases occurred during 
the 1980s and early 1990s, and though they have 
ﬂ attened somewhat in the recent decade, they still 
persist at a very high level.

The decision to go to college has a profound effect on 
wages; however, we have seen that both college major and 
the pursuit of an advanced degree have a critical impact 
on the value one receives from a college education as well. 
Other factors affecting the return to college not discussed 
here include college quality, occupational choices, hours 
worked, and the relevance of unobserved skills.

7,"Wage Premium From College Is Said to Be Up

By Shaila Dewan 

February 11, 2014 8:23 pm

The reason, they discovered, is that even though a college degree is worth more, a high
school degree alone is worth a lot less. Its value, in terms of wages, has declined enough to
cancel out almost all the gains by all the millennials who have earned four-year degrees.

From 1965 to 2013, according to a new Pew report called “The Rising Cost of Not

Going to College,” the typical high school graduate’s earnings fell more than 10 percent, after
inflation.

“That is one of the great economic stories of our era, which you could define as income

inequality,” said Paul Taylor, an author of the report. “The leading suspects are the digital
economy and the globalization of labor markets. Both of them place a higher premium on the
knowledge-based part of the work force and have the effect of drying up the opportunities for
good middle-class jobs, particularly for those that don’t have an education.”

Even middle-class jobs that are still available increasingly require a college degree,

either because they require more skill than they used to or because employers have become
pickier.

The Pew report found that the wage premium for having a college degree was at a

record high. The median annual wage for young college-educated workers now is $45,500,
compared to $28,000 for high school graduates — a gap of $17,500. In 1965, the gap was
much smaller: $7,400. (All the figures are in 2012 dollars.)

Not surprisingly, in a survey conducted by Pew, young college graduates were more

likely to report satisfaction with their careers. “On virtually every measure of economic well-
being and career attainment — from personal earnings to job satisfaction to the share
employed full time — young college graduates are outperforming their peers with less
education,” said the report, which included economic data from the United States Census in
the analysis of the survey results.

The value of a college degree is well established, but the high cost of tuition and fees
has made many question whether it is worth the investment. Most young college graduates
surveyed by Pew said their degree had already paid off or would pay off, even though many
are saddled with debt. In the survey, 66 percent of millennials said they had borrowed to pay
for school, compared to 59 percent of Gen Xers, those aged 33 to 48, and 43 percent of baby
boomers, ages 49 to 67.

“For today’s young adults, the only thing more expensive than going to college is not
going to college,” Mr. Taylor said. “And that sort of captures the dilemma that many find
themselves in.”

Beyond the College Earnings Premium. Way Beyond.

By Philip Trostel  JANUARY 29, 2017

 

André da Loba for The Chronicle

A

t a time of rising tuition, it is understandable that

proponents of higher education trumpet the college

earnings premium. Despite the rising cost, a college

education is still practically a windfall-proﬁt investment for most

graduates. In 2012, Americans with bachelor’s degrees and without

advanced degrees earned over $32,000 a year more than high-school

graduates who never attended college.

Over an average lifetime, this premium is $1,383,000, conservatively

assuming that the earnings premium does not continue to increase,

as it has for decades. Moreover, with this ﬁnancial payoff comes the

value of substantially better health and longer life expectancy, the

value of employer-provided fringe beneﬁts such as health insurance and retirement plans, and the intrinsic lasting value of the

college experience. Paying the full sticker price at an elite private college just for the average beneﬁt is still a great investment.

But raising awareness of the college earnings premium has an important unintended side effect: It fuels the perception that a

college education is primarily a private good — that the only beneﬁciaries are the individuals earning degrees. And if a college

education is only a private good, then there is no need for public support of higher education. Private goods are effectively

provided in free markets, and it is only fair that the beneﬁciaries should be the ones to pay.

The increasing belief that a college education is mostly a private good is apparent in American public-spending priorities. Despite

rising college enrollment, the share of government spending devoted to higher education has been shrinking steadily since about

1980. Government spending on higher education as a fraction of national income has also been shrinking since the early 1980s.

Taxpayer contributions to higher education relative to net student/family contributions have decreased substantially in recent

decades. Our policy behavior speaks loudly that the perceived public value of a college education has been eroding.

And yet, higher education is clearly not just a private good. Knowledge creation from university research is an obvious public

good. This suggests using tax dollars to support such research, if not necessarily to support college attainment.

There are important public beneﬁts from college attainment, though. In addition to the great ﬁnancial payoff to graduates,

college attainment creates at least four important types of beneﬁts for others:

Increased productivity. Given the college earnings premium, it is hardly surprising that regions of the country with higher
proportions of college graduates have higher per capita incomes. The disparity, though, is substantially greater than can be

explained by the higher incomes of the graduates. In other words, a college education seems to create more aggregate income

than the sum of the higher incomes paid to graduates. It appears that a college education not only raises the productivity and

income of those getting the degrees but also raises the productivity and income of others.

Fiscal support. It is also hardly surprising that college graduates pay substantially more taxes than those who did not go to
college. Hence college graduates contribute more to the ﬁnancing of public goods that beneﬁt everyone. The magnitude of this

effect may be surprising. Over an average lifetime, graduates with bachelor’s degrees but without advanced degrees pay $563,000

more in taxes than high-school graduates who never attended college.

College graduates also create less in government expenditures on public assistance and social insurance, thus beneﬁting others

by freeing resources for other public services and/or reducing others’ taxes. Over an average lifetime, college graduates without

advanced degrees receive $50,000 less in Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, unemployment beneﬁts, and other such

beneﬁts than do high-school graduates who never attended college.

The additional taxes and the reduction in the need for beneﬁts that results from college attainment far exceed taxpayer support

for higher education, making college a great investment for taxpayers as well. Moreover, just the reduction in transfer payments

may exceed government spending on higher education, in which case public support for higher education may reduce the overall

size of government.

Philanthropic participation. College attendance increases generosity signiﬁcantly. College graduates without advanced degrees
donate more than three times as much cash to charities each year as do high-school graduates who never attended college. The

estimate errs on the low side because it not does include the value of noncash donations, posthumous gifts, or gifts to individuals.

The greater earnings of college graduates accounts for roughly half of the additional cash donations. The other half comes from

college graduates’ donating a higher proportion of their earnings to charity — 2.3 percent compared with 1.6 percent.

Volunteerism, too, increases signiﬁcantly with college attainment. Working-age bachelor’s graduates without advanced degrees

volunteer at 2.3 times the rate of high-school graduates who did not go to college. That puts total annual philanthropic

contributions more than $3,600 — 4.7 times — higher per bachelor’s degree. Total average contributions are 4.1 percent of

earnings for those with high-school diplomas, compared with 8.2 percent for those with bachelor’s degrees.

Civic engagement. College graduates are more-active participants in democracy, voting at higher rates and being more politically
involved. They are also more active in their neighborhoods through participation in community organizations, working on

community projects and attending community meetings. College-educated adults are also more likely to interact with their

neighbors. In addition, they are less likely to be involved in criminal activities. In short, college education helps make our

communities better places to live.

And these are just the measurable public beneﬁts. Their combined value is probably greater than the college earnings premium,

perhaps substantially so. The list does not include other vital public effects that are almost impossible to quantify, such as the

positive inﬂuences on arts, culture, innovation, and tolerance.

It is not overstatement to call the typically emphasized effect on earnings just a small portion of the beneﬁts of college

attainment. Yet the ﬁnancial payoff alone is too often portrayed as the sole beneﬁt of college. Until this portrayal of what makes a

college education worthwhile is changed, the longtime erosion of public support is likely to continue.

What’s more, access to a college education may well continue to be compromised, which makes not just the potential students

who are deterred, but all of us, worse off.

In response to a new study finding that only a small portion of 2009 college graduates had jobs lined up,
the National Journal posed the question How Can Colleges Help Graduates Pursue a Career? EPI
research associate Richard Rothstein argued that the problem rests not with the preparation colleges
were providing, but with larger economic trends, particularly a shortage of jobs. His complete response
follows:

Colleges and other educational institutions can influence which students get the more highly-skilled jobs
that are available. But colleges and other educational institutions cannot, to a significant extent, affect the
number of jobs that are available – highly skilled or otherwise.

This truth is obvious in our current economic crisis. Nobody can seriously believe that if colleges made
graduates more attractive job candidates, this would cause the unemployment rate for college graduates to
fall. If employers are now filling vacancies for recent college graduates in a number equal to only 20% of
their class, surely this is not because graduates are insufficiently attractive as candidates. The
unemployment rate for those with a college degree (including both mature workers and recent graduates)
was 4.8% in May, up from 2.1% at the start of the recession, and higher than at any time since 1979.

These unemployment numbers are probably understated. Anecdotes abound that many young college
graduates, though not technically unemployed, are forced to begin their careers as interns at low rates of
pay and sometimes with no pay at all. This phenomenon does not seem to be a product of the current
recession – it has apparently been growing even when the economy was strong. If there were truly an
economic shortage of well-educated workers, employers would have gobbled up these undercompensated
and uncompensated college graduates, at regular rates of pay.

The number of available jobs (including those that require college education and those that do not)
depends upon the size and growth of the economy, affected in turn by demand-side factors such as the
strength of consumer (public and private) demand and credit availability. Education reform cannot
influence such factors. 
Yet while this truth is obvious in today’s economic crisis, at other times many observers forget it and
assert a fiction: that if more students graduated from college as attractive job candidates, more would find
highly-skilled jobs requiring college education. This fiction assumes that when our economy is not in
recession, there is a shortage of college graduates available to fill jobs requiring college education.

But this fiction is just that. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has consistently projected that the number of
college graduates in the U.S. labor market will continue to match (or exceed) the number of job openings
requiring college education. Indeed, BLS finds that many of the largest areas of future job growth in the
American economy are in occupations requiring little skill, not even a two-year post-secondary credential
– waiters and waitresses, retail salespersons, truck drivers, janitors, home health aides. This reality will
not be changed if only colleges could make their graduates more attractive candidates.

Many of those who see a skills crisis in the American economy, attributable to inadequate education,
confuse the fastest growing job categories with the job categories having the largest openings. It is true
that many (though not all) of the fastest growing categories require post-secondary education, but this fast
growth starts from relatively small bases, so does not generate many new jobs for college graduates.

Others point to the gap in wages between college and high school graduates, a gap that at some (but not
all) times during recent decades has grown, and conclude that this reflects a supply-demand imbalance. In
reality, during much of the last 40 years, the wages of college-educated workers in science, technology,
engineering and math have been stagnant or growing very slowly. The giant wage gains of college
graduates in some recent years are attributable to big boosts in compensation of managers and sales
workers (for example, in Wall Street and similar finance occupations). It is hard to take seriously a claim
that the giant bonuses paid to finance workers in the last decade are indicative of a nationwide shortage of
college graduates.

In actuality, the demand for college graduates has slowed considerably since the 1980s, even at times
when the college-high school wage premium was growing. 
My colleague at the Economic Policy Institute, Lawrence Mishel, and I have, in previous work, noted
that productivity growth in the American economy has been extraordinary until the recent economic
crisis, especially in comparison to that of other industrialized countries. If the American workforce did
not have sufficient skills to use the most advanced available technology, such productivity growth could
not have been possible.

Much of our education policy in recent years has been driven by the inaccurate belief that if only all
students could qualify for post-secondary education and then become “attractive job candidates,” all
youth would then obtain well-compensated jobs that took advantage of these qualifications.

But our true challenge is quite different. When this recession is over, it will still be the case that attractive
candidates for jobs requiring a college education will not be in short supply. And if we succeed in
preparing more students for college, and supporting them as they complete it, an economic surplus of
college graduates will grow. With hourly compensation for college graduates flat from 2002 to 2008, this
can only mean that pay will start declining. It is already the case that new college graduates earn less and
get less generous benefits than those at the beginning of this decade. The economic issue is not how to
generate more and better-prepared college graduates. Rather, our challenge is to break a system where the
best predictor of which students obtain a college education and access to the limited number of good jobs
available is so easily predicted by the race, education, and material circumstances of those students’
parents.

In a contemporary environment where only 20% of college graduates can find jobs appropriate to their
education and training, this inequity can only get worse. 
Confronting this inequity, in a social and economic system where occupational privilege is necessarily
limited, requires changes in our social, economic, and educational institutions that go beyond improving
the quality of preparation received by college graduates. For example, if we are serious about increasing
the competitiveness of minority youth for a limited number of the most desirable jobs, we must make this
competition more palatable for advantaged youths who, in greater numbers than before, may lose out. It is
hard to imagine how losing can be made more palatable without making the consequences of losing less
severe-ensuring that those with only a high school or associate college degree (roughly sixty percent of
the workforce), and even college graduates who cannot find employment requiring a college degree, have
jobs which are decently paid. This will require addressing the excessive income inequa 
lity we’ve developed as a nation, not a topic usually considered by educators or education experts.

Nothing I have said here should be taken to minimize the importance of getting more young people
prepared for college, and through it. We may have an economic surplus of college graduates, but not a
cultural or civic surplus. There are many reasons to raise the educational level of our population besides
workforce preparation. But the notions that we face an economic calamity if we don’t dramatically boost
the number of college graduates, or that inadequate college preparation is stunting their access to jobs, is
simply wrong.

POSTED  
SEPTEMBER 13, 2010

A College Education of Diminishing Returns

The Law of Diminishing Returns is a nasty little ordinance…and few aspects of life escape its
tyranny.

A short list of exceptions would include sex and world peace…or at least world peace. (To be
sure about sex, a poll of long-married couples might be necessary). Suﬃce to say that this
Law wields more power over life than any formal statute in the US penal code.

For proof of this fact, consider the lamentable condition of “the college education.” Once
upon a time, a college education in America was a one-way ticket to a high-paying job and a
lofty socio-economic status. Part of its value derived from the fact that a college education
was relatively rare. In 1950, only about 5% of all Americans held a bachelor’s degree.

Since this 5% tended to fare so much better than the rest of the American population, lots of
folks began to ask themselves, “Why not send as many kids as possible to college?”

This simple question sparked what would become a massive “college bubble.” This simple
question spawned myriad scholarship programs, a college-construction boom…and Sallie
Mae – née the Student Loan Marketing Association in 1972.

Today, more than 25% of Americans hold a bachelor’s degree – five times more than in 1950.
But guess what? A bachelor’s degree ain’t what it used to be. The Law of Diminishing
Returns is having its way.

According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, more than half of all 2007
college graduates who had applied for a job had received an offer by Graduation Day. In
2008, that percentage tumbled to 26%, and to less than 20% last year. Statistics like these do
not inspire confidence in a college degree.

More and more Americans have Alma Maters for which to cheer; but fewer and fewer have
employment prospects worth cheering about. While it’s true that a college degree tends to
correlate with a relatively high income, the nearby chart clearly shows that this relative high
is drifting lower. During the last eight to ten years, the median income of highly educated
Americans has been declining.

These statistics are troubling, even before examining their price tag. And what a price tag it
is! The average annual tuition (plus expenses) at a private nonprofit four-year college is
about $35,000. That’s $140,000 for four years – or just a little bit less than the median cost of
an American home. How did prices ever get this crazy?

Thank Sallie Mae – vendor extraordinaire of student loans. Thanks to Sallie, and the industry
she pioneered, most of the nation’s college graduates now possess far more debt than
opportunity. According to FinAid.org, the total amount of money Americans have borrowed
on government and private student loans at $830 billion has surpassed the total American
consumer balance on credit cards, only $827 billion. But the problems wrought by Sallie
Mae are far more pervasive and insidious than mere indebtedness.

Were it not for Sallie Mae, aspiring college graduates could never have borrowed far more
money than they could ever hope to repay; universities could never have begun to believe
that they are worth what they charge; professors could never have obtained their coddled
lifestyles and the cost of a college education could never have appreciated well beyond any
connection to its true economic value.

And herein lies the dirty little truth about an advanced degree – it doesn’t always do much
advancing.

“Sometimes things we believe for good reason our whole lives turn out one day to no longer
be true, because circumstances have changed,” writes Jack Hough in a delightful little article
for SmartMoney. “Consider two childhood friends, Ernie and Bill. Hard workers with helpful
families, each saves exactly $16,594 for college. Ernie doesn’t get accepted to a school he
likes. Instead, he starts work at 18 and invests his college savings in a mutual fund that tracks
the broad stock market.

“Throughout his life,” Hough continues, “Ernie makes average yearly pay for a high school
graduate with no college, starting at $15,901 after taxes and peaking at $32,538. Each month,
he adds to his stock fund 5% of his after-tax income, close to the nation’s current savings
rate. It returns 8% a year, typical for stock investors.

“Bill has a typical college experience. He gets into a public college and after two years
transfers to a private one. He spends $49,286 on tuition and required fees, the average for
such a track. I’m not counting room and board, since Bill must pay for his keep whether he
goes to college or not. Bill gets average-size grants, adjusted for average probabilities of
receiving them, and so pays $34,044 for college.

“He leaves school with an average-size student loan and a good interest rate: $17,450 at 5%.
The $16,594 he has saved for college, you see, is precisely enough to pay what his loans don’t
cover.

“Bill will have higher pay than Ernie his whole life,” Hough relates, “starting at $23,505 after
taxes and peaking at $56,808. Like Ernie, he sets aside 5%. At that rate, it will take him 12
years to pay off his loan. Debt-free at 34, he starts adding to the same index fund as Ernie,
making bigger monthly contributions with his higher pay. But when the two reunite at 65 for
a retirement party, Ernie will have grown his savings to nearly $1.3 million. Bill will have less
than a third of that.

“How can that be?” Hough asks rhetorically. “College degrees bring higher income, but at
today’s cost they can’t make up the savings they consume and the debt they add early in the
life of a typical student. While Ernie was busy earning, Bill got stuck under his bill.”

“The great enemy of the truth,” John F. Kennedy declared in a 1962 commencement address
at Yale University, “is very often not the lie – deliberate, contrived and dishonest – but the
myth – persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.”

Fifty years later, a Yale education, itself, may be one small part of a vast American myth.
Send your kids to Yale if you want; but don’t be surprised if the grads over at New Haven
High are faring better financially a few years from now.

As a well-heeled acquaintance from Manhattan quipped recently, “Hey it’s gonna cost me
$250,000 to send my kid to an Ivy League school. I’d rather just use the money to buy him a
business, and let him figure it out in the real world.”

The logic is compelling.

Snapshot for February 22, 2006.

It is conventional wisdom that earnings have grown faster for college graduates than for high-school
graduates.  This long-term wage trend has led economists to conclude that the skill demands of American
employers have outpaced the supply of skilled workers in the U.S. labor market, thus demonstrating a
shortage of college-educated workers.

In his first testimony as Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke called this increase in the “skill
premium” the “most important factor” in explaining the increase in inequality.  The new version of the
Economic Report of the President (ERP), written under Bernanke as chairman of the Bush Administration
Council of Economic Advisers, makes the same argument.

There is, however, a problem with this reasoning: according to the ERP’s own data, the wage premium
for skill has contracted sharply over this business cycle. Since 2000, the real earnings of college-educated
workers (those with bachelor’s degrees) have fallen quite steeply, while the earnings of high-school
graduates have gone up.  So according to Bernanke’s and the ERP’s logic, such  results would suggest
that, since 2000, the supply of college graduates (typically labeled “skilled workers” in this debate) has
grown faster than employers’ need for them, and that the supply of high-school graduates (“less-skilled
workers”) has not kept up with demand.  Obviously, such a trend undermines claims that it’s the skill
level of U.S. workers that is the chief factor behind the growth in inequality.

Figure 1, taken from the ERP (Table 2-1), shows the increase in the ratio of annual earnings of college to
high-school workers.  This ratio increased from 57% to 93% in the 1975-2000 period, a significant
increase in the relative earnings of college graduates; it is this trend that has informed much of the debate
regarding the alleged “skills mismatch” of the U.S. workforce.

Between 2000 and 2004, however, there is a large decline in this ratio, driven by the 5.2% fall in the real
earnings of college graduates over this period (Figure 2 ) that coincided with an increase (albeit modest)
in high-school graduates earnings.

Of course, even with this sharp loss, college workers have a significant earnings advantage over those
with lower levels of education, and the Bush Council of Economic Advisers is absolutely right to stress
the importance of a highly educated workforce. 

Nevertheless, policy makers and “futurists” predicting a shortage of skilled labor need to be aware of this
reversal in the college premium, especially since it contradicts their explanation of evolving skill
demands.  It’s possible that the recent results could represent a short-term reversal of a trend that will
soon revert back to its prior course (our own research, however, shows that the trend in the college
premium flattened in the latter 1990s).1 

We could, however, also be witnessing the downward pressure on the earnings growth of college-
educated workers due to the offshoring of skilled jobs that had in earlier years commanded a significant
2
earnings premium.

4,""The college earnings premium is near
record highs

Lisa Scherzer August 10, 2016

It’s been a pretty solidly established fact by now, but in case there’s any
lingering doubt about whether it’s worth it to go to college, here’s more
evidence.

The college earnings premium—the ratio of earnings for those with a
college degree to earnings for those with a high school degree—has
reached historical highs in recent years.

Council of Economic Advisers

In 2014, the median full-time, full-year worker over age 25 with a
bachelor’s degree earned nearly 70% more than a similar worker with
just a high school degree. Jason Furman, head of the White House’s
Council of Economic Advisers tweeted out this chart illustrating the
earnings premium after the July jobs report was released last Friday,
citing findings from a July report by the CEA.

Over the course of a career, the median worker with a bachelor’s degree
will earn nearly $1 million more than the same type of full-time worker
with just a high school diploma, according to the CEA report which
covers trends in student borrowing and repayment. The same type of
worker with an associate’s degree earns a premium of about $360,000.
(It does, however, take longer for some to break even on their college
investment than others, as Goldman Sachs pointed out last year.)

“Higher education may be the single most important investment that
young Americans can make in their futures,” the authors wrote. (The
CEA report also touts President Obama’s PAYE plan which caps
monthlystudent loan payments at 10% of discretionary income, and
which the White House says is benefiting nearly 5 million borrowers.)

In addition to higher earnings, college graduates are also 1.3 times more
likely to work than those with just a high school degree. The report cites
BLS data showing that college graduates with “at least a bachelor’s
degree participate in the labor force at a higher rate than high school
graduates (74% vs. 57% in 2015) and also face a lower unemployment
rates among those who participate (2.6% vs. 5.4% in 2015).”

Council of Economic Advisers

And, by the way, in June Georgetown University Center on Education
and the Workforce gave yet more weight to the college-is-worth-it
argument with its report that found that out of the 11.6 million jobs
created in the post-recession economy, 11.5 million went to workers with
at least some college education. And of those jobs, 8.4 million went to
workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher.
 
Another bonus for grads: they have higher odds of moving up the
economic ladder and experience “a wide range of non-economic benefits
like health and happiness,” according to the CEA report, which cites past
research.

Despite the stark difference in earnings and employment between the
degree-haves and have-nots, the report delves into why some students,
burdened by their student loans, don’t end up better off after college.

Here are 3 more takeaways from the report:

College returns vary and it’s especially bad for for-profit students

Overall, the financial benefits of a college education are high, but of
course, it doesn’t work always work out great for everyone – particularly
for those who attend for-profit schools.

The years following the Great Recession saw a spike in student-loan
borrowing, driven largely by students attending for-profit and community
colleges and by those from low-income families. The problem is that
many of these schools “yield low or even negative returns, especially for
students who do not complete degrees,” according to the study. Between
2009 and 2015, outstanding debt grew by 158% for community college
borrowers and 142% for for-profit borrowers, compared to an overall
increase of 107% in outstanding undergraduate debt.

For a comparison, check out this chart:

Council of Economic Advisers

After three years, borrowers from nonprofit and four-year public schools
have paid down 15% of their original balance on the whole, compared
with only 8% and 3% at community colleges and for-profits, respectively.

For-profit students, the CEA report says, are “more likely to be
unemployed, to default on their loans, and to say that their education
was not worth the cost.”

Size of your loan matters

Outstanding student debt in the US has reached a whopping $1.3 trillion
as of 2015. And although individual federal debt levels have been
mushrooming and outstanding balances of $40,000 or more are not
uncommon, there is a bright spot: the debt burden owed by the typical
student is on the “modest” side.

As of June 2015, the majority of borrowers with outstanding
undergraduate loans owed less than $20,000 (the average amount of
undergraduate loans held in 2015 was $17,900); 42% owed less than
$10,000; and only 10% owed more than $40,000, the CEA says. It’s
typically graduate-school borrowers who have heftier debt loads: 43%
owed more than $40,000 in graduate loans.

Council of Economic Advisers

Dropouts fare worse

Who’s most likely to default on their student loans? According to the
CEA, low-income borrowers, those who attend for-profit or community
colleges, part-timers, and especially, those who don’t finish their
degrees.

Defaults are concentrated among borrowers with small-volume loans, in
large part because these borrowers are less likely to have completed
their degrees. Loans of less than $10,000 accounted for nearly two-
thirds of all defaults for the 2011 cohort three years after entering
repayment. Loans of less than $5,000 accounted for 35% of all defaults.

The report found that among undergraduate borrowers who entered
repayment in 2011, those who didn’t finish their degree defaulted at a
25% rate after three years, compared with just 9% among those who did
complete. And after three years, 58% of degree-holders had paid back at
least a dollar of their loans, contributing to a 14% decline in their original
balance. Of those who didn’t finish, only 39% of had paid down a dollar
of their initial balance and 94% of their original balance remained unpaid
after three years.

ABSTRACT 

The Returns to Elite College Education: 

A Quasi-Experimental Analysis* 

 
I take advantage of a sharp discontinuity in the probability of admission to an elite university 
at the admission score threshold, to estimate causal returns to college education quality. I 
use  a  newly  constructed  dataset,  which  combines  individual  administrative  records  about 
high school, college admission, college attendance and tax returns. Students with score just 
above  the  admission  threshold  have  52%  higher  yearly  income  with  respect  to  just-below-
threshold students. This premium is equivalent to a jump from the 44th percentile to the 74th 
percentile  of  the  income  distribution.  The  richness  of  the  data  allows  me  to  explore  the 
counterfactual  college  career  of  not  admitted  students  and  the  potential  mechanisms 
underlying  the  estimated  income  premium.  I  find  that  students  with  a  just-above-threshold 
score  are  less  likely  to  be  college  dropouts,  take  six  fewer  months  to  graduate,  choose 
different  majors  and  are  more  likely  to  have  income  in  the  top  quartile  of  the  distribution. 
Cumulated over fifteen years, the time span of income data for my sample, the net premium 
of attending the elite university amounts to around $120,000.

Introduction

Every year, students pay higher tuition to attend elite universities because they observe

higher returns for their graduates. But to what extent diﬀerences in earnings reﬂect better

students selecting into elite institutions? Estimating causal returns to education quality is

a complex endeavor because students select into better universities based on unobservable

characteristics that may also be correlated with higher potential earnings. While this se-

lection issue has been extensively analyzed by the literature on the returns to education

attainment (Angrist and Krueger 1991, Ashenfelter and Krueger 1994, Duﬂo 2002, Ichino

and Winter-Eber 2004), few studies have tackled it credibly in the context of returns to ed-

ucation quality. Estimates of the returns to college quality obtained without accounting for

selection tend to overestimate the returns to attendance of a highly selective college.1 In the

recent years, there has been intense debate about tuition fee hikes and excessive students’

borrowing. The Obama administration has long worked to construct a ranking (a “college

scorecard”2) aimed at helping students choose colleges that “oﬀer good value for their tu-

ition dollars”3 and linking federal funding to it. While the scorecard provides substantial

information on the cost of attendance and median earnings of graduates for each univer-

sity separately, the government has abandoned the goal of publishing an actual ranking of

universities. Rankings based on graduates’ average or median earnings may indeed give a

misleading representation of the value added of diﬀerent universities and thus cause intense

discontent among university administrators.4

To isolate the causal returns to educational quality, previous studies have used several

econometric techniques. Dale and Krueger (2002,2011) compare earnings of graduates of

selective college to those of students admitted at equally selective universities, but chose to

4Alternative rankings, not based on earnings, have been proposed by other scholars. Avery et al. (2013)
for example make use of college choices of high-achieving students to create a revealed preference ranking of
American colleges and universities).

attend less selective institutions. They ﬁnd positive returns only for low-income students.

Brewer et al. (1999) model high school students’ choice of university and estimate a 40%

earning premium for attending an elite private institution relative to attending public uni-

versities. Other studies rely on the comparison of twins: Behrman et al. (1996) focus on

female twins and ﬁnd evidence of positive returns to attending private universities with well-

paid senior faculty, while Lindahl and Regner (2005) use Swedish sibling data and show that

within-family estimates of the wage premium to college quality are half of the cross-sectional

estimates. Andrews et al. (2012) focus instead on quantile treatment eﬀects and compare

the wage distribution of graduates from a ﬂagship state university to a counterfactual wage

distribution of students from non-selective institutions that assumes same observable char-

acteristics as for the selective university. They ﬁnd an 11.5% premium for attending the

ﬂagship state university. Several other works use a regression discontinuity approach to

deal with selection in various educational contexts (Abdulkadiroglu et al. 2014, Hastings et

al. 2013). Hoekstra (2009) exploits a discontinuity in the admission rule of a U.S. ﬂagship

state university and estimates a 24% premium in earnings for its graduates. Saavedra (2008)

examines the extent to which college quality aﬀects students learning, employment and earn-

ings in Colombia. More recent works use also a regression discontinuity design to estimate

returns to elite college education on the marriage market (Kaufmann et al. 2013), returns

across degree programs (Hastings et al. 2013, Kirkeboen et al. 2014) and the returns to

college admission for students that are at the margin of attending university (Zimmermann

2014).

In this paper, I expand and improve on the approach used by Hoekstra (2009). I control

for selection into elite college education by exploiting a sharp discontinuity in probability of

admission to an elite Italian university at the admission score threshold. I use self-collected

administrative data from the city of Milan that combine individual high school data, college

admission data, college performance and tax returns to estimate labor market returns to

attending the private elite college for graduates between 24 and 39 years old. I am also able

3

to link family and spatial background information. My quasi-experimental approach relies on

the assumption that applicants obtaining a score close to the admission threshold are locally

randomly assigned to elite university attendance.

Idiosyncratic shocks in admission test

performance and relative academic quality make admission close to the unknown threshold

as good as random. Several tests consistently validate this fact.

This paper oﬀers several important contributions to the literature. First, I am able to

track university choices, academic performance and labor market outcomes of the coun-

terfactual college careers of individuals not admitted.5 To my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst

paper to use administrative data available for both admitted and not-admitted students to

shed light on the mechanisms through which college quality aﬀects individual labor market

outcomes. Second, the “sharp” nature of the discontinuity in the admission probability of-

fers a methodological improvement. Admissions at the elite university that I consider are

based on a uni-dimensional numerical score. No subjective evaluations such as recommen-

dation letters or essays are considered for admission. This allows me to predict perfectly

the admission outcome as a function of the admission score. Third, the nature of the higher

education market in Milan provides a common support of students attending universities

with substantially diﬀerent degrees of selectivity and quality. I compare the position in the

Italian income distribution of graduates of universities in Milan vis-a-vis the position in the

US income distribution of graduates of US universities. I ﬁnd that the median graduate at

the elite university in my setting earns as much as a graduate of Duke University, while the

counterfactual student graduating in other non-selective universities in Milan earns approx-

imately like a graduate of Durham Technical Community College (the local college for Duke

University). While in the U.S. students who just missed admission at Duke University are

most likely attending a similar-quality college elsewhere in the country, in my setting the

jump in university quality and selectivity for just-below-threshold students is substantial.

Fourth, the fact that I focus on a geographically delimited labor market with low mobility

5Hoekstra (2009) did not have the counterfactual college information available

4

for graduates allows for a proper comparison of income across individuals.6 This allows

me to overcome concerns about regional earnings heterogeneity that aﬀects college quality

estimates in markets with high mobility of college graduates such as the U.S. one.

My estimates show that attending the elite university yields an average 52% premium in

yearly income. In distributional terms, this premium is equivalent to a shift from the 44th

percentile of Italy’s national income distribution to the 74th percentile. The U.S.-distribution-

equivalent yearly income premium would be $19,952, which corresponds to roughly 65% of the

U.S. College/high school premium. I take into account the higher tuition fees for attending

the elite university and I estimate that the cumulative discounted net returns to enrolling at

the elite university 15 years after graduation are $120,000 (EUR 108,535). I calculate that

40% of the observed diﬀerence in average income between graduates of the elite university

and other college graduates can be attributed to selection. I also explore the heterogeneity

of the R.D. estimates along the income distribution and ﬁnd that attendance at the elite

university is linked to a “lottery eﬀect” at the threshold. Students with an admission score

just above threshold are 66% more likely to be in the top quartile of the income distribution.

The eﬀects I ﬁnd are sizeable. Thanks to the richness of my data, I can exploit counter-

factual information of students that were not admitted at the elite university and explore

the potential underlying mechanisms.

I ﬁnd that students that are just-above threshold

for admission to the elite university are more likely to complete a college degree, take 6

fewer months to graduate and are exposed to a far better selected set of peers. When inter-

preting the magnitude of the estimated premium it is important to take into account that

the elite university focuses on degrees in economics and business. I check for the presence

of a discontinuity in the choice of major at the admission score threshold and ﬁnd that

just-above-threshold students are 30 percentage points more likely to choose economics or

business as their major. After taking into account the eﬀect of the diﬀerent major choices

on income, I ﬁnd that the “net” institutional quality eﬀect of attending the elite university

6Most of the students graduating from universities in Milan end up working in the Milan metropolitan

area, as it is one of the most thriving and productive regions of Europe

5

is approximately 30%.

These results provide new evidence of the large returns to attending a top quality col-

lege compared to not-selective institutions, even after controlling for selection in a quasi-

experimental setting. The analysis of the mechanisms and the methodology used in this

paper represent important contributions for both the literature and education policy.

2 Data and setting

The master sample in the analysis consists of a group of 30,000 individuals who graduated

from college preparatory high schools (in Italian, “Licei”) between 1985 and 2005 in the city

of Milan (Italy), a large service-oriented metropolitan area in the wealthiest part of Italy.

College educated individuals from this city often become part of the Italian elite in business,

ﬁnance and academia. High school data for these individuals have been collected from 13

diﬀerent high schools and contain information on high school exit test, class peers, teachers

and the location of their home. The high school master data have been linked to multiple

sources of administrative data as illustrated in Figure 1. They have been matched (using

names and date of birth) to student records at the 5 main universities in Milan. These

universities oﬀer a broad set of majors and are considered in the country. Every year, there

are around 40,000 freshman students and a total of 160,000 students attending college in

Milan (Italian Ministry of Education, 2014). The majority of the students that graduate

from college preparatory high schools in Milan applies to one of these 5 universities. In this

speciﬁc sample, 83% of all high school graduates obtain a college degree and among all college

graduates almost 90% of them are matched to the data of at least one of the 5 universities in

Milan.7 For the matched students I am able to reconstruct their university career: whether

they graduated, in what year, in what ﬁeld of study, in what university and with what ﬁnal

exit score. In a further step, the initial 30,000 records of the college preparatory high school

7Of the 10% unmatched students graduating from college, 68% attended another Italian university outside

Milan, while the rest went abroad for their college studies.

6

graduates have been linked to internal revenue service data on personal gross income for year

2005, the only year for which I was able to obtain individual administrative records.8 The

home addresses where students lived during high school have been geocoded and matched

to house market values.9 Moreover, for a stratiﬁed 10% random sub-sample of all high

school graduates, more detailed information has been collected from telephone interviews

conducted in June 2011.10 The additional information include many variables such as family

background, parental income, job and education, current employment and current family

situation of the individual.

Finally, I have merged these data with records from the admission oﬃce of the most

selective university among the ﬁve in Milan. The admission oﬃce performed the match

using the name, birth date, high school and year of high school graduation of each individual

and returned the matched data after full anonymization. The admission oﬃce matched

information for all high school students in the master data (both admitted and not admitted).

However, the university has kept digital databases for the admission sessions from 1995

onwards, half of the cohorts available in my data. Figure B1 graphically shows the “time-

line” of admission information availability. Every year on the time axis represents a cohort

of students graduating from Milan college-preparatory high schools and applying to college

in that year. As summarized in Figure B1, data on admission for the elite university for the

1995 to 2005 high school cohorts and not for the 1985 to 1994 ones. Background information,

high school and college performance data, income for tax year 2005 and phone survey data

obtained in 2011 are available for all cohorts.

8The administrative ﬁle of reported income includes all individuals in the country and it is mandatory to
report any income. If a person does not appear is because he/she has no income or he/she lives outside the
country. Self-employed are included in the sample.

9House value data have been provided by the governmental agency “Agenzia del Territorio” for 55 neigh-

borhoods of the city

10The survey was conducted by “Carlo Erminero & Co.”, an Italian company specialized in surveys.

2.1 The elite university under analysis

Table 1 summarizes relevant statistics for the elite university vis-a-vis the average char-

acteristics of the other four universities of Milan under analysis. The elite university is

characterized by substantially diﬀerent institutional characteristics, degrees of selectivity

and outcomes. It is smaller in size (has around 11,000 students enrolled every year with

respect to an average of 39,000 for the other universities), has 93% higher expenditures per

student, 13% higher salaries per instructor, but does not have a better student-to-instructors

ratio. Net of scholarships and tuition fee discounts, attending the elite university costs 3.7

times more on average than the other universities11.

Students attending the elite university are highly selected on their pre-college charac-

teristics. Their high school exit scores12 are substantially (44%) higher. While the average

student attending the elite university scores in the 71th percentile of the Milan high school

exit score distribution, the average student in the other 4 universities scores in the 48th per-

centile. When compared to the U.S. distribution in the SAT composite score, this diﬀerence

is equivalent to a 210 points gap (a score of 1680 vs 1470). Students at the elite university

also come from wealthier families, have more educated mothers and their fathers are 42%

more likely to work in leadership occupations.13

Average diﬀerences in students’ outcomes are also substantial. Students graduating from

the elite university have average annual income (between 1 and 15 years after graduation)

that is 87% higher than graduates of the other four universities. In distributional terms,

while the average income of an elite university graduate lies at the 85th percentile of the

2005 Italian income distribution, the one of a graduate of the other Milan universities is at

the 44th percentile. The U.S.-distribution-equivalent yearly income gap is higher than $40,000

($64,369 vs $23,886 in the 2005 U.S. income distribution). More than 60% of them (between

elite university under analysis, while the other state universities require low token fees

and graded by external committees. Scores are thus comparable across schools.

25 and 45 years old) work in leadership occupations (managers, professionals, directors or

business-owners) with respect to 39% of other graduates. They are also more likely to work

abroad. However, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the employment rate of the graduates

of the elite university, with very high employment rates (above 90%) of all college graduates

in Milan.

In Table 2 I compare labor market outcomes and selectivity of the universities under

analysis with the U.S. university system. I use the data provided by the U.S. Department

of Education College Scorecard14 to compare Milan college students with students of US

universities. In the top panel, I use the U.S.-income-distribution-equivalent income of Milan

college students (as calculated in Table 1) and compare it with the income of U.S. college

graduates. While the median graduate of the elite university under analysis is placed in

the income distribution similarly to graduates of Duke University and Carnagie Mellon, the

median graduate of all other Milan universities is placed much further down in the income

distribution at levels comparable to substantially lower ranked colleges in the same states of

Duke University and Carnagie Mellon (respectively, Durham Technical Community College

and the Community College of Philadelphia).

In the bottom panel of Table 2, I exploit

the SAT-distribution equivalent score (as calculated in Table 1) to compare the selectivity

of the universities under analysis to the selectivity of U.S. colleges. While in terms of

graduates’ income the elite university is comparable to top-ranked U.S. universities, it is

less selective than top-ranked U.S. distribution (comparable to good state universities such

as UC-Irvine and UC-Santa Cruz). On the other end, the non-elite universities in Milan

have an extremely low level of selectivity compared to the U.S. system. Table 2 shows that

the elite vs. non-elite universities selectivity gap in my data is comparable to the diﬀerence

between UC-Santa Cruz or UC-Irvine and schools such as the California Baptist University

of Riverside or Fresno Paciﬁc University. This gap is not surprising since, contrary to the

elite university, the other universities in Milan did not have admission tests for most of the

period under consideration.15

Two important features of Italian university education (features that are in common

with all other European countries) are relevant for this study. First, admission to Italian

universities is degree-speciﬁc: students apply for a speciﬁc ﬁeld of study at one or more

universities. In order to change degree after enrollment, a student must wait for the following

round of admissions (once a year) and make a new application. Where an admission test

is required, it is administered by the single university. There is no centralized admission

system. Second, not every university oﬀers degrees in all ﬁelds of study. In Figure B2 I show

the breakdown of enrollment at each university and in each ﬁeld of study in my sample.

The elite university oﬀers degrees in Business, Economics and Law16 with a wide range of

specializations, from public policy to “management of arts, culture and fashion”. Its mission

emphasizes the preparation of managers and leaders with a strong economic background in a

very wide range of ﬁelds. For this reason the elite university attracts a large part of students

with preferences for degrees diﬀerent from Economics and Business as showed later on in

this paper.17

Overall, the descriptive statistics show that students who attend the elite university

are highly selected on pre-college characteristics and have substantially better labor market

outcomes. This suggests that selection bias might play an important role in determining

the large gap in student outcomes. The quasi-experimental analysis presented in the next

sections will shed light on the relevance of this selection bias.

15Exceptions are Engineering, Architecture and Medicine programs in the recent years.
16The faculty of Law opened during the years under analysis, but it was very small. Thus, in my analysis

I focus on individuals applying for Business and Economics only.

17Degrees in Economics and Business are also oﬀered by the other private university in the sample and
one of the public universities (“Public university 3” in the diagram). The three public universities represent
a large share of all college students in Milan and their degree oﬀerings respond to both specialization and
scale criteria: “Public university 1” in ﬁg. B2) focuses on engineering, architecture and design while the
other two have a large set of ﬁelds. “Private university 2” focuses on social sciences, including Humanities,
Economics, Business and Education.

10

2.2 The admission rule

The admission procedure of the elite university is based on an objective uni-dimensional

composite score that equally weights the high school exit exam score and the admission test

score.18 Applicants are ranked according to this score. Every year, the number of admitted

students is ﬁxed at N before the admission test is taken and every year the N students

with the highest composite score are oﬀered admission.19 It is very diﬃcult for applicants to

predict the admission score cutoﬀ because of idiosyncratic shocks to applicants’ performance

in the admission test, the relative diﬃculty of the admission test, cohort size and the quality

of students attempting the test each year. The admissions oﬃce of the elite university

provided the exact score and ranking position of each applicant.

Figure 2 shows the discontinuity in the probability of admission and enrollment at the

admission threshold for applicants. The composite admission score has been standardized

for each admission session and then re-scaled to be 0 at the admission threshold. The

standardized score can thus be interpreted as the number of standard deviations from the

admission threshold, allowing me to pool together individuals applying to diﬀerent admission

sessions over the years. While until year 1999 there was a single admission threshold per year

for the entire university, starting from the year 2000 admissions were determined separately

for each speciﬁc degree (e.g. business degree, economics degree, marketing degree, etc. ) and

thus several rankings and admission thresholds were determined each year. For admissions

after 2000, I have thus re-scaled each degree-speciﬁc admission threshold to be 0. Given the

objective nature of admission scores, I am able to identify a sharp discontinuity in probability

of admission. Since not every admitted student ends up enrolling at the elite university, the

discontinuity in the probability of enrolling at the elite university is not sharp, although it

is very large. About 70% of admitted students in my sample end up enrolling in the elite

18The admission test is administered by the elite university simultaneously for all students, is multiple

choice and is identical for all students.

19In the years under analysis there were on average 3200 students attempting the test with 2200 spots

available (68% admission rate).

university. There are two possible reasons for which students admitted to the elite university

may decide not to enroll. Either the students prefer to major in a ﬁeld not oﬀered by the

elite university (e.g. engineering) or they may be credit constrained (tuition at the elite

university is almost four times higher than tuition at the other universities).

In my analysis, I exploit the sharp discontinuity in the probability of admission to estimate

the eﬀect of admission on income. This can be interpreted as an “intent to treat” eﬀect, since

not all admitted students actually attend the elite university. I also use a fuzzy discontinuity

approach to estimate the eﬀect of enrolling at the elite university on income.

3

Identiﬁcation strategy

Given the sharp nature of the discontinuity in the probability of admission, I ﬁrst estimate

the eﬀect of admission on income with a parametric RD model with ﬂexible polynomials of

diﬀerent orders (Lee and Lemieux, 2010):

log(yi) = δ0 + ρ I(xi,t ≥ xt

∗) + δ1f (xi,t − xt

∗) + δ2f (xi,t − xt

∗) ∗ I(xi,t ≥ xt

∗) + i

(1)

where log(yi) is the natural log of the adjusted annual income20 of individuals that have 1
to 15 years of potential experience on the labor market. I(xi,t ≥ xt
∗) is a dummy equal

to one if the running variable xi,t (the composite admission score) is above the admission

∗ for each year of admission t, f (xi,t − xt

is the interaction of the polynomial of the composite admission score with the discontinuity

dummy, included to allow the slopes of the polynomial functions to be ﬂexible below and

above the threshold. In this sharp discontinuity context ˆρ is the estimate of the admission

eﬀect on income. This estimate can be seen as an “intent to treat eﬀect” since not every

20Since income is observed for the year 2005 for cohorts of students graduating from high school between
1985 and 2005, I regress individual log income on cohort ﬁxed eﬀects and retrieve the residuals. This allows
me to make a more fair comparison of income across cohorts.

12

admitted student actually enrolls in the elite university.

When interpreting the running variable xi,t in this setting, it is important to keep in mind

that the measurement unit of the standardized admission score (standard deviations) refer

to the admission composite score which is calculated only for the sub-sample of individuals

applying to the elite university. Figure 3 shows the distribution of high school exit scores for

students applying to the elite university and those that did not apply and do not take the

admission test. The distribution for students applying to the elite university is substantially

shifted to the right (mean is 0.4 high school exit score standard deviations higher) and has

lower variance. The sub-sample of students on which my RD analysis is run is thus already

very homogenous and positively selected with one standard deviation in the admission com-

posite score representing only a relatively small diﬀerence in the quality of the students with

respect to a standard deviation of the high school exit score.

In order to estimate the enrollment eﬀect on income, I use a fuzzy regression discontinuity

approach: I estimate the discontinuity in the probability of enrolling at the elite university

and use it to re-scale the discontinuity in income estimated in Speciﬁcation (1).21 I implement

a two-stage least square approach in which I estimate the predicted probability of enrolling
at the elite university (cid:92)p(enrolledi = 1) with the following ﬁrst stage regression:

p(Enrolledi = 1) = θ0 +πI(xi,t ≥ xt

∗)+θ1f (xi,t−xt

∗)+θ2f (xi,t−xt

∗)∗ I(xi,t ≥ xt

∗)+ηi (2)

in which p(Enrolledi = 1) is a dummy equal to 1 if the student is observed enrolling at the

elite university and ˆπ is the estimate of the discontinuity in the probability of enrollment at

the threshold. All other right hand side variables are as in Speciﬁcation (1).

We can think of the eﬀect of enrolling at the elite university as the estimate ˆτ of the fol-
∗) serves as an instrument for the probability

lowing second stage equation in which I(xi,t ≥ xt

13

p(Enrolledi = 1):

log(yi) = γ0 + ˆτ (cid:92)p(Enri = 1) + γ1f (xi,t − xt

∗) + γ2f (xi,t − xt

∗) ∗ I(xi,t ≥ xt

∗) + i

(3)

One can easily show that the enrollment eﬀect ˆτ is the result of re-scaling the discontinuity in

income ˆρ by the discontinuity in the enrollment probability ˆπ: replacing (2) into (3) indeed

leads to τ π = ρ and thus τ = ρ

π . In Section 5 I present estimates for ˆπ, ˆρ and ˆτ .

Due to the absence of precise admission data for the cohorts applying to the elite univer-

sity between 1985 and 1994 and the fact that I only have tax returns data for the year 2005,

I can perform regression discontinuity estimation with complete admission information and

income for the sample of cohorts applying to the elite university between 1995 and 2001.

Figure B1 illustrates the time line of the data. The main set of results presents estimates of

the returns to admission, enrollment at the elite university using this sub-sample of younger

cohorts.

A second identiﬁcation strategy allows me to exploit also the information for the full

sample. For cohorts applying to the elite university between 1985 and 1994 (as well as for

1995-2005), the high school exit score (which determines the composite admission score for

50%) is available from the high school dataset. Moreover, I have data on enrollment and

graduation at the elite university for all cohorts. I exploit a numerical simulation method

and the richness of my data to estimate the missing pieces of admission information.

I

present a formal model for this numerical simulation in the Technical Appendix A, but I

summarize the intuition here. I pool all cohorts that applied to college between 1985 and

2001 together and use pre-college characteristics and the subsample of younger cohorts with

complete information to predict the missing pieces of information for the older cohorts. These

raises two issues. One derives from the fact that I observe students that applied to the elite

university only if they enrolled after being admitted. I thus need to identify the applicants in

my sample who did not enroll into the elite university (i.e. applicants who were not admitted

14

and applicants who were admitted but did not enroll). To do so I run a probit model with the

probability of applying to the elite university conditional on not enrolling on the left hand

side and a wide range of pre-college high school and background variables on the right hand

side for the ten post-1994 applying cohorts for which I have complete admission information.

I then perform an out-of-sample prediction (conditional on pre-college characteristics) and

assign predicted probabilities of applying at the elite university conditional on not enrolling

to cohorts graduating from high school before 1994.

I also estimate the proportion α of

students in my post-1994 sample who apply to the elite university and do not enroll in each

year. The second issue is the absence of the exact admission composite score for the elder

cohorts. As mentioned earlier, the missing admission composite score is determined by an

equally weighted average of the university-speciﬁc admission test and the high school exit

score, which is available for all cohorts. I thus use only the high school exit score as a running

variable for the elder cohorts.22 Moreover, I do not know the minimum admission score for

these cohorts. For each admission session for which I do not observe the admission outcome,
∗ in the high school

I run the following OLS regression for each of k possible thresholds xt,k

exit score and choose the threshold for which I obtain the highest R2:23

P (Enrolledi) = β0 + β1I(xi,t ≥ xt,k

∗) + i

(4)

with P (Enrolledi) being a dummy equal to one if student i enrolled at the elite university
and I(xi,t ≥ xt,k
∗) being a dummy equal to one if the high school exit score is higher than the
∗. All these estimation steps are then repeated a hundred times in a numerical

threshold xt,k

bootstrapping simulation to retrieve estimates for the return to elite education using all

22I have run also a more complex simulation in which I predict the score for the university-speciﬁc admission
test that is missing for elder cohorts using the estimates of the predicted score for younger cohorts for which
I have complete admission information. I then estimate the predicted admission test score out of sample
for elder cohorts based on a large set of background characteristics. Finally, I use the imputed admission
test together with the observed high school exit score to recreate the missing composite score for admission.
Results obtained with this second simulation are available upon request.

discontinuity in probability of admission at a state ﬂagship university.

cohorts in my sample. In this numerical simulation, I ﬁrst sample ˆα ∗ Cohort size students

using the out of sample predicted probabilities of applying to the elite university (conditional

on not enrolling) as weights. This forms my control group. Next, I combine the predicted

control group with the observed treatment group (students observed enrolling at the elite

university) and estimate the threshold using equation (4) separately for each admission

session before 1995. Finally, I pool the cohorts together and run the regression discontinuity

estimation of equation (3) for the probability of enrollment.

4 Validity of the design

The main identiﬁcation assumption for my empirical strategy is that assignment around the

threshold that determines treatment is locally random (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). Before

presenting my results, I test the validity of this assumption in several ways. The local

randomness condition may be violated if the probability of treatment (i.e. the probability of

admission at the elite university) around the threshold depends on observable or unobservable

characteristics that are correlated with the outcomes under study. In this context, this would

manifest in the manipulation of admission outcomes around the threshold by individuals with

speciﬁc characteristics (e.g. if students with better potential outcomes can actively target a

score right above the admission threshold). In the institutional setting under analysis, given

the ﬁxed number of admitted students, the purely objective admission procedure (i.e. no

recommendation letters and no soft skill evaluations) and the idiosyncratic variation in ability

of each year’s applying cohort, it is extremely hard for students as well as for the admission

oﬃce to predict the cutoﬀ score for admission. However, if there were any manipulation,

16

we would observe a discontinuity in the density of applicants at the admission threshold

(McCrary, 2008). Figure 4 shows that the density of applicants is continuous through the

threshold. This is reassuring evidence that scores were not manipulated. Panel A includes

data for all years of admission in the data, including the post-year-1999 admissions that

were determined at a degree-speciﬁc level. As explained in section 2.2, I have re-scaled each

degree-speciﬁc threshold to be 0, so that for admission years after 1999 there are several

cutoﬀ scores per year and the running variable as to be interpreted as standard deviations

from each degree-speciﬁc threshold. As a result of this, for years 2000 and over the number

of individuals in Panel A the density appears a little higher around the cutoﬀs (on both

sides) then away from it. However, the smoothness of the density across the threshold (what

matters for the test) is preserved.

In panel B of Figure 4, I restrict the density test to

admission years before 2000 for which there was a single admission cutoﬀ score for the entire

university and show that the density behaves regularly also away from the threshold.

A second test of local random assignment to the treatment veriﬁes that pre-treatment

characteristics are smooth across the threshold. This is analogous to a test for balance

of background characteristics in an experimental study. Table 3 and the corresponding

Figure 5 show that this “smoothness” condition is veriﬁed for several relevant background

characteristics. Estimates are obtained with a parametric sharp discontinuity speciﬁcation

with ﬂexible linear polynomial as presented in Section 3, Speciﬁcation (1). Standard errors

are clustered at cohort-high school level.24 The ﬁrst outcome is a pre-college proxy for

family wealth, average house value in the city block where students lived at time of high

school attendance. The estimate of the discontinuity coeﬃcient is not signiﬁcant and small

in magnitude (0.045 with respect to an average logarithmic house value of 8 and a standard

deviation of 0.33). In Column 2, I focus on high school background characteristics. I ranked

the high school institutions present in my sample according to an index of the average

performance of students on the high school exit exam. The index varies between zero and

24A cluster corresponds to a group of same-cohort students graduating in a given year from one of the

high schools in the sample.

17

one. The results show that the quality of the high school attended by the students applying

to the elite university is smooth across the admission threshold. In Column 3, I repeat the

same exercise using a proxy for the average wealth of parents by school (i.e. the average

house value of students at the school). This is an important check for my design, because

it shows that students coming from the most selective high schools in Milan have the same

probability of being admitted close to the threshold as other students. It also indicates that

the admission procedure is based on objective scores and that there is no informal admission

channel, nor extra weight given to students coming from elite high schools. In Column 4, I

use a diﬀerent background measure that takes into account high school peers’ characteristics

and social economic status, the geographical concentration of high school classmates based

on an Herﬁndhal Index. This index is calculated on the neighborhood where the high school

students used to live at the time of high school attendance. The more students in the high

school class live in same neighborhoods, the higher the class geographical concentration

index. Data show that geographically concentrated high school classes are substantially

more common in high schools situated in less aﬄuent neighborhoods of the city. While the

best high schools attract the highest performing kids from all neighborhoods in the city,

periphery schools only attract a local pool of students.25 This type of geographical selection

into high schools is the reason why students in these geographically concentrated classes also

have substantially lower scores on the high school exit exam relative to students of other

schools. On the one hand, this index can be seen as a proxy for low socio-economic status and

academic performance. On the other hand, students in classes that are more geographically

concentrated are more likely to interact also after school (since all students live in the same

neighborhood) and to have tighter network. If we are concerned that some students have

information that allows them to target the admission threshold, it is more likely that this

information is shared in these geographically concentrated classes. If this hypothesis were

true, we should observe a larger mass of students with a higher Herﬁndhal Index just right

25There is no geographical restriction to high school attendance in Italy.

of the admission threshold. However, also this background characteristic is continuous at

the admission threshold.

In Appendix Table B1, I show that results of Table 3 are robust to smaller bandwidths and

hold for other background characteristics. In Table B2, I repeat the same test of smoothness

using the high school curriculum26 of the students and their gender. The coeﬃcient of interest

remains insigniﬁcant. A remaining threat to my regression discontinuity is selection of the

tax records. If students right below admission threshold are less likely to be matched to tax

returns records, my estimates may be biased. As Column 3 of Table B2 shows, this is not

the case. I also show that the probability of observing income exactly equal to zero in the

tax returns is continuous across the threshold.

5 Results

Table 4 and Figure 6 present my main estimates for the returns to elite college attendance for

the sample of cohorts applying to the elite university between 1995 and 2001 (the cohorts for

which I have complete admission data). Standard errors are clustered at cohort/high-school

level. Columns 1 and 2 present estimates of the parameters as described in Section 3 with a
linear and a quadratic polynomial respectively, restricting estimation to a bandwidth of ±3

standard deviations of the composite admission score around the threshold.27 The sample of

students on which my RD analysis is run, the sub-sample who take the test for admission at

the elite university, is very homogenous and positively selected (as shown in Figure 3) with

one standard deviation in the admission composite score representing only a relatively small

diﬀerence in the ability of the students with respect to a standard deviation of the high school

exit score. The ﬁrst row of the table shows the sharp discontinuity estimate in income at

26College preparatory high schools in my sample oﬀer either a curriculum in classical studies or one in

scientiﬁc studies.

27All speciﬁcations in Table 4 include gender and the family wealth proxy (parents’ house value) as controls.
As standard robustness check for regression discontinuity estimates I replicate results of Table 4 excluding
control variables in Appendix Table B3. Results remain unchanged. As in a fully experimental estimations
including background controls should increase the total variance explained by the model, but should not
change the estimates of the treatment.

the admission threshold, which represents the admission eﬀect. Given that not all admitted

students decide to enroll in the elite university, we can consider this estimate as an “intent to

treat” eﬀect. The eﬀect is sizeable, around 41 logarithmic points.28 The second and the third

row present the fuzzy discontinuity estimates for the eﬀect of enrolling at the elite university.

Enrollment eﬀects (second row of Table 4) are larger then the admission eﬀect, around 52

logarithmic points. The bottom panel of Table 4 shows the estimated discontinuities in the

probability of enrolling. These are the ﬁrst stage estimates used to re-scale the admission

eﬀect to obtain enrollment eﬀect in the “Wald-estimate” setting described in Section 3.

Figure 6A shows graphical representation of the estimated discontinuity in income of Table

4, Column 1. While the downward sloping linear ﬁt to the left of the threshold might seem

counter-intuitive, a deeper look at the data clariﬁes why this happens. Although the share

of “high-S.E.S.” students is quite ﬂat along the distribution of the admission score to the

right of the threshold, it is increasing to the left of the threshold and spikes up on the left

tail of the distribution. Among the lowest performing students, there is a wide majority of

students from very wealthy families. The income for these students might thus be correlated

with their social background relatively more than to school performance.29 Moreover, the

negative slope coeﬃcient left of the threshold is not statistically signiﬁcant.

When estimating the discontinuity using the quadratic polynomial speciﬁcation in Col-

umn 2 of Table 4, the magnitude of the coeﬃcients tend to increase. Although the estimates

are not statistically diﬀerent across the two speciﬁcations, Figure 6B gives some guidance

on why the estimates for the quadratic polynomial tend to be larger. By examining the

ﬁgure it appears that the quadratic parametric interpolation for the control group (i.e. the

non-admitted student) is driven by the outliers at the very bottom of the admission score

28Under the semi-logarithmic speciﬁcation the eﬀects measured are a good approximation of the eﬀect in
percentage change as long as the eﬀects are close to 0. To be more precise, the estimate ˆτ in percentage
change must be transformed as follow: eˆτ − 1. In this case the percentage change correspondent to the 41
logarithm point change is 50%

29In other words, while low S.E.S. students do not apply and do not even take the elite university admission
test unless they know they have a substantial chance to be admitted, high S.E.S. students apply and take
the test even if they have very small chances of admission.

distribution furthest from the threshold.30 In Columns 3 and 4, I test the robustness of my
results by restricting the estimation to smaller bandwidths (±2 and ±1 standard deviations

around the admission threshold). In Column 3, the results are similar in magnitude to those

of Column 1, while for an even smaller bandwidth the estimates tend to be larger. Although

I am careful in interpreting the coeﬃcients of estimates obtained with smaller bandwidths
given the relatively small sample size (especially the speciﬁcation with the ±1 bandwidth

is very demanding), it is clear that estimates for returns to elite college attendance remain

sizeable even in the most demanding speciﬁcations.

As a robustness check, I have replicated the estimation using data-driven bandwidth

selection methods and non-parametric, bias-corrected RD estimators as proposed by Calonico

et al. (2014a, 2014b). All estimates are consistent in sign and signiﬁcance with the ones

found in Table 4 using parametric estimation, but are in all speciﬁcation slightly larger in

magnitude. This suggests that the enrollment eﬀect (around 52 logarithmic points as in

second row of Table 4) might represent a lower bound for the income premium generated

by attending the elite university. Results for the estimates based on Calonico et al. (2014a,

2014b) are available upon request.

In Figure 7 I test whether my results are truly capturing a causal discontinuity in income

at the admission threshold or they are instead result of an idiosyncratic jump in income that

happens close to the admission cutoﬀ score. I plot the estimated discontinuity ˆρ at the true

cutoﬀ score and at other placebo cutoﬀ scores 0.1 or more standard deviations away from

the true cutoﬀ. Whiskers represent precision of each estimate. Panels A-D reﬂect the same

4 speciﬁcations as in Table 4 and Figure 6. These ﬁgures conﬁrm that the only signiﬁcant

income discontinuity present in the data is at the true threshold reassuring on the causal

interpretation of the estimated returns to admission at the elite university.

30These outliers are the consequence of the “thin” left tail in the admission score distribution.

21

6 Discussion

In this section, I discuss my results in the context of the literature, present a robustness

check, study whether the eﬀects are heterogenous across the income distribution and explore

potential mechanisms. I also use a simple cost-beneﬁt analysis to provide an estimate for

the cumulative discounted net returns to elite college education.

As shown in Table 4, I estimate sizeable returns to admission and enrollment at the elite

university (respectively 40 and 52%). These returns are marginally smaller in magnitude

than the average returns to college graduation with respect to high school, which are between

45% and 75% according to diﬀerent causal estimates from the literature (see Oreopoulos and

Petronijevic, 2013 for a review of these estimates). In distributional terms the estimated

52% premium is equivalent to a jump from the 44th percentile of Italy’s national income

distribution to the 74th percentile. The U.S.-distribution-equivalent yearly income premium

is $19,952 ($43,838 for graduates of the elite university vs. $23,886 for the other graduates).

For comparison, the estimated $19,952 premium to attending elite education amounts to

roughly 65% of the U.S. College/high school premium ($29,125), as calculated by Autor

(2014).

When compared to other studies that estimate returns to college education quality, my

estimates are among the largest. Hoekstra (2009) ﬁnds that U.S. students attending a

ﬂagship state university earn 24% more than those who attend non-ﬂagship state universities,

while Brewer et al. (1999) estimate a 40% earning premium to attending an elite private

institution relative to attending a low quality public college. When interpreting my results,

it is important to take into account the institutional context. In terms of selectiveness and

outcomes, the diﬀerence between the elite university and the other universities under analysis

is comparable to the case of U.S. private elite college versus public or community colleges (see

Section 2.1). In addition, the education “quality treatment” is more intense in my setting

than in the context of a ﬂagship institution in a homogenous college public system.31 The

31While the median graduate of the elite university under analysis is placed in the income distribution

22

other institutional feature that may inﬂuence the size of the estimated returns is the choice

of major. As I will discuss in Section 6.3 students’ preferences for institutions and majors32

are not lexicographic and just-below-threshold students are substantially less likely to major

in Economics and Business with respect to just-above-threshold ones.

From a policy perspective, it is interesting to compare my quasi-experimental estimates

of the returns to elite college education with the unconditional diﬀerence in mean income

across universities. The average income of students attending the elite university are 87%

higher than those of students attending less selective universities in Milan. Comparing this

to the 52% income premium estimated with the regression discontinuity implies that about

40% of the unconditional mean premium is due to selection. This suggests that producing

rankings based on graduates’ average income would substantially overestimate the value

added of attending elite universities.

6.1 Extending estimation to older cohorts

Results are signiﬁcant and robust to diﬀerent speciﬁcations. However, the small sample size

may raise some concerns about the credibility of my estimates. I thus extend my analysis

to those cohorts applying to the elite university between 1985 and 1994 for which I observe

only a partial component of the admission score, by exploiting an alternative identiﬁcation

strategy as presented in Section 3 and described more in detail in the Technical Appendix

A. Including older cohorts in the analysis has two main advantages. First, it substantially

increases the number of observations. Second, it allows me to extend estimation of returns

to individuals who are 6 to 15 years passed graduation instead of focusing on the ﬁrst 5

years on the labor market only.33 In Table 5 I report the estimate obtained by extending the

similarly to graduates of Duke University and Carnagie Mellon, the median graduate of all other Milan
universities is placed much further down in the income distribution at levels comparable to lower-ranked col-
leges in the same states of Duke University and Carnagie Mellon (respectively, Durham Technical Community
College and the Community College of Philadelphia)

32In the European context students apply for speciﬁc majors in speciﬁc universities and each university

oﬀers a limited bundle of majors.

33When exploring returns over the experience proﬁle, it is important to keep in mind that I am not able
to properly disentangle the eﬀect of labor market experience from cohort eﬀects since I observe income for

23

estimation to the older cohorts. Column 1 of Table 5 include the preferred estimate obtained

with the sample of younger cohorts for which I have complete admission information (as from

Table 4). Column 2 estimates the eﬀect of enrolling in the elite university using all cohorts

available and the numerical bootstrapping procedure explained in the Technical Appendix

A. The estimates are extremely similar in magnitude, while the standard errors drop by

50%.34 This exercise reassures me on the validity of the estimates obtained with the smaller

sample and provides an estimate of the returns to enrollment in the elite university also for

the elder cohorts.

6.2 “Lottery-ticket Eﬀect”

In this section, I explore the possibility that elite college attendance aﬀects income heteroge-

neously over the income distribution. In particular, I investigate whether attending the elite

university increases the probability of reaching the top of the income distribution.35 Figure

8 sheds light on this question. I estimate the eﬀects of enrolling at the elite university on the

probability of being in the qth quantile of the income distribution. Each dot in the graph rep-

resents a diﬀerent speciﬁcation in which the left-hand-side is a dummy variable that takes on

value one if the income observed from tax returns is above or equal to the qth quantile of the

income distribution. Whiskers represent precision of estimates. The ﬁgure shows that the

discontinuity is stronger (around 11 percentage points) for the probability of having income

between the 70th and the 80th quantile of the income distribution. We can interpret this as

evidence of a lottery-ticket eﬀect that allows students right above the admission threshold

to reach the top quartile of the income distribution. On the other hand, this exercise shows

that no “insurance eﬀect” is present (there is no discontinuity in the probability of being in

year 2005 only. Therefore, I can analyze returns by years since graduation only under the assumption that
returns to experience are constant across cohorts

34By increasing the sample size three times, precision doubles. This is the result of a trade-oﬀ for which
I improve precision by increasing the sample size, while reducing it because of measurement error while
estimating the unknown threshold for elder cohorts as described in Section 3.

35A recent working paper by Zimmermann (2015) explores a similar channel, estimating the eﬀect of elite

college admission on students chances of reaching top management positions

24

the bottom quartile of the income distribution at the admission threshold)

6.3 Mechanisms

The estimates in Table 4 are large and represent the reduced form estimates of the labor

markets returns to attendance at the elite university under study. However, what are the po-

tential mechanisms through which admission to the elite university yields such large returns?

In this section, I take advantage of the richness of my dataset to explore how admission to

the elite university aﬀects academic decisions and performance. As summarized by Figure 9,

the mechanisms I explore in my analysis are college completion, time to graduation, choice

of major and peer composition. However, other relevant mechanisms such as signaling and

human capital are not easy to analyze empirically with my data and are thus not discussed

in this work.

In Table 6 and the relative Figure 10, I explore the presence of discontinuities at the

admission threshold for four academic outcomes of interest.36

I show estimates for the

baseline parametric speciﬁcation with linear ﬂexible polynomials and with a bandwidth of
±3 standard deviations around the admission threshold (as for the main results Table 4

Column 1). In Column 1 I focus on the probability of graduating from college. Students that

were just above the admission threshold were 13.6 percentage points more likely to graduate

than just-below threshold ones, with respect to a 73% baseline probability of graduation.

Admission to the elite university may have an impact also on the time students take to

complete a degree. Tuition fees at the elite university are three times higher than for the

other universities. This might constitute a strong incentive to avoid delaying graduation or

an incentive to perform better and obtain higher returns.37 In Table 6, Column 2, I thus

check the presence of a discontinuity in “time to graduation”.38 The estimate shows that

36In Appendix Table B4, I show that results of Table 6 are robust to smaller bandwidths.
37Garibaldi, Giavazzi, Ichino, Rettore (2012), using a Regression Discontinuity Design, ﬁnd that an increase
of 1,000 euro in tuition fees reduces the probability of late graduation by at least 6.1 percentage points with
respect to a benchmark average probability of 80%

38Since I cannot observe time to graduation for college dropout students, I have imputed as time to

25

just-above threshold students take 6 fewer months to graduate than just-below threshold

ones. College completion and time to graduation appear to be an important channel in

explaining the returns to attending the elite university. Although I cannot make causal

statements on why the elite university substantially increases probability of graduation and

reduce time to degree, there must be some characteristics of the elite university educational

environment that determine these outcomes. The elite university may have better incentives

in place to encourage students to complete their college education and to complete it earlier.

A more intense instructor-student interaction or a more rewarding learning experience might

play a role. Looking back at Table 1 might shed some light on the institutional features that

might aﬀect these academic outcomes. The level of expenditures per student are clearly

higher (93% higher) in the elite university, however only a small fraction of these higher

expenditures appear to be invested in better-paid and thus better-quality faculty (the elite

university pays only 13% more per faculty member than other universities). The other

dimensions on which the elite university invests substantially more than the other universities

in Milan are infrastructures (e.g. buildings, computers, labs, student spaces, etc.), services

to students (e.g. career service, international exchange programs, etc.) and services to

faculty (e.g. administration, teaching and research assistants, etc.). These dimensions might

all contribute to increase the probability of completing college and reducing time to degree.

Another important factor that goes beyond teaching quality and infrastructures is the quality

of peers. In Column 3 I estimate a discontinuity in the average quality of peers (deﬁned as

students in one’s cohort who enroll in same university and program). Estimates show that

just-above threshold students are exposed to peers that had substantially higher (more than

a standard deviation higher) score in the high school exit exam. Exposure to higher-skilled,

more motivated student peers might thus play a crucial role in explaining the improved

academic performance for just-above-threshold students at the elite university.

Although it remains challenging to identify the speciﬁc institutional features that posi-

graduation the maximum time to graduation in my data after excluding outliers (more than three standard
deviations away from the mean).

26

tively aﬀect these academic outcomes, higher and faster college graduation, and exposure to

higher skilled peers are clearly relevant features to factor in the bundled “value added” of

attending this elite university.

In Column 4 of Table 6, I test weather the choice of major is one of the relevant mech-

anisms in explaining the estimated returns to elite college attendance. More speciﬁcally,

I focus on the probability of choosing an Economics or Business major as outcome in my

speciﬁcation. The elite university oﬀers a broad range of courses, but all formally listed

under the faculty of Business and Economics, which may lead admitted students to major

in this ﬁeld more than others. Column 4 of Table 6 shows that students with a score just

below the admission threshold are 33 percentage points less likely to major in Business or

Economics. Figure 10 shows this graphically. In Figure B3 I show which majors students not

admitted at the elite university chose. Only 58% of them major Business and Economics,

while the remaining 42% majored in Law (16%), Humanities (5%), Engineering (4%), Social

Sciences (4%) or other majors. This reveals the interesting fact that preferences of students

for university and majors are not lexicographic: students do not rank institutions by speciﬁc

chosen major or choose major conditional on university as it naturally happens in the U.S.

context. On the contrary, they rank a bundle of institution and major choices.

Baseline diﬀerences in income by major are large and the discontinuity in Column 4 of

Table 6 shows that admission to the elite university substantially increases the probability

to choose a degree in economics and business. The choice of major is clearly an important

mechanism in determining the returns to attending the elite university under study. One

might be tempted to run the baseline regression discontinuity speciﬁcation on income by

restricting the analysis to students (both admitted and not admitted) who major in eco-

nomics and business to get an estimate of the returns to elite college attendance for students

graduating in the same major. However, in this context the choice of major is an outcome

of the admission process (as shown clearly by the discontinuity in the choice of major at

the cutoﬀ) and the very heterogenous selection into diﬀerent majors shown in Figure B3 for

27

students that were just below the admission threshold is clearly endogenous. Restricting the

analysis to students who choose Economics and Business or including ﬁxed eﬀects for major

choice in this context would lead to the same selection issues arising when controlling for an

outcome in a standard regression setting.39 Therefore, I follow an alternative “back of the

envelope” method to disentangle the eﬀect of attending the elite university from the eﬀect of

choice of major. I exploit the sample of younger cohorts not included in the main regression

discontinuity analysis (and thus “exogenous” to the estimated quasi-experimental estimates

of returns to elite college attendance) to estimate returns to major choice, net of the eﬀect of

university. I do so by using a mincerian speciﬁcation in which I include dummies for choice

of major (omitting Economics and Business) and university dummies. Column 1 of Table 7

shows returns to choice of majors relative to returns to choosing Economics and Business.

In column 2 I instead report the share of students in the regression discontinuity sample (i.e.

later cohorts for which I have estimated the quasi-experimental estimates of returns to elite

college education) that I observe choosing each major (other than Economics and Business)

after missing admission to the elite university. In column 3 I calculate the average expected

returns to choosing majors other than Economics and Business (weighted for the observe

shares of students choosing each alternative major) for the sample of students that were just

below threshold for admission to the elite university. This exercise relies on two important

caveats: average returns to major are the same for earlier and older cohorts and baseline

returns to choosing Economics and Business (net of the university speciﬁc eﬀect) are the

same for students admitted to the elite university and those that were not admitted.40

I

estimate an average weighted return to choosing majors other than Business and Economics

of -0.19% for my speciﬁc sample of not-admitted students. Keeping in mind the important

caveats mentioned above, we can disentangle the 52% estimated eﬀect for enrolling in the

elite university, by attributing a 19% eﬀect to the diﬀerent choices of major made by not-

40This latter caveat conceptually reﬂects the baseline regression discontinuity assumption for students who

are in a close interval around the admission threshold.

28

admitted students and by interpreting the remaining 33% as the residual institutional eﬀect

of enrolling at the elite university, net of the major choice. Such an estimate is close to (still

slightly larger) those estimated by previous literature in similar contexts (i.e. Hoekstra,

2009).

Besides the more academic mechanisms analysed in this section, an array of other quality

components aﬀecting income remain unexplored in this work. Institutional reputation and

signaling may inﬂuence individual income, especially in the ﬁrst years on the labor market.

Peer eﬀects may also be relevant for the labor market outcomes. As shown in the descriptive

statistics, just-above-threshold students are exposed to peers that have substantially higher

academic performance and come from relatively wealthier and more educated families. This

may aﬀect the type of networks available to the just-above-threshold students before and

after graduation.

6.4 Net discounted returns

While the annual income premium of attending the elite university is large and signiﬁcant,

it is interesting to evaluate the net returns after taking into account the substantially higher

tuition fees. In Table 8 I present a “cost-beneﬁt” calculation that takes into account expected

net yearly tuition, expected time to graduation and a baseline 3% discount rate to translate

the estimated annual income premium to the net returns to investment. The calculation is

based on the income premium estimated on all cohorts available for the ﬁrst 15 years after

graduation (Table 5) and on the discontinuity in time to graduation as estimated in Table 6.

Table 8 shows that the cumulative discounted net returns to enrolling at the elite university

measured 15 years after graduation are equal to $119,389 (EUR 108,535). Alternatively,

this means that the net returns to enrolling in the elite university are positive already in

the 3rd year after graduation. By repeating the same exercise using the “pure” institutional

estimate (after taking into account the eﬀect of the choice of major) presented in Section

6.3, the net returns to attending the elite university 15 years after graduation are $71,729

29

and turn positive in the 4th year after graduation.

7 Conclusions

I exploit a newly collected administrative Italian dataset following students from high school

through college and into labor market, to estimate returns to enrolling at an elite uni-

versity in the city of Milan. The administrative dataset has been matched to individual

records from the admission oﬃce of the elite university under analysis.

I take advantage

of a sharp discontinuity in the probability of admission at the admission score threshold to

obtain quasi-experimental estimates of returns to enrollment. This regression discontinuity

approach allows me to overcome concerns of selection bias due to students selecting into elite

universities based on unobservable characteristics correlated with potential income.

I estimate a 52% annual income premium for students enrolling at the elite university

under analysis.

In distributional terms, this premium is equivalent to a shift from the

44th percentile of Italy’s national income distribution to the 74th percentile. The U.S.-

distribution-equivalent yearly income premium would be $19,952 ($43,838 for graduates of

the elite university vs. $23,886 for the other graduates). This premium amounts to roughly

65% of the $29,125 U.S. College/high school premium, as estimated by Autor (2014).

I explore the mechanisms underlying such a large eﬀect. I ﬁnd that students obtaining

an admission score just above the admission threshold are more likely to complete a college

degree and take six fewer months to graduate. I also estimate a large discontinuity in the

choice of major. Just-above threshold students are 30 percentage points more likely to

choose economics or business as their major. This suggests that preferences of students

for institutions and majors are not lexicographic. Students do not rank institutions after

choosing a speciﬁc major, but make bundled “institution/major” enrollment decisions.

I

show that, net of the major choice, the residual institutional quality eﬀect of attending the

elite university is 33%. This estimate is in line with those previously estimated by other

30

papers in similar contexts.

I explore how attending the elite university aﬀects income across the income distribution

and ﬁnd evidence of a signiﬁcant “lottery-ticket eﬀect”. Just-above threshold students have

higher probability to have income in the top quartile of the national income distribution.

On the other hand, they are not signiﬁcantly less likely to end up in the bottom quartile of

the income distribution.

Breaking down the eﬀect of college quality on income into single quality components is a

complex task. The estimates I obtain must be interpreted as the eﬀect of the “bundled” qual-

ity of the elite university. This includes multiple educational inputs such as faculty, research

and organization, and also the eﬀect of signaling, reputation and peer eﬀects. Interestingly,

the discontinuity in enrollment determines a radical change in the average characteristics of

college peers. The evidence I ﬁnd of a discontinuous increase in the probability of completing

college for just-above-threshold students suggests that the educational environment of the

elite university may motivate students more, ceteris paribus. Competitive and motivated

peers or more eﬀective teachers might play a role in this.

I also present a cost-beneﬁt analysis that takes into account yearly tuition, average time

to graduation and a discount rate to translate the estimated annual income premium to

discounted net returns to investment. The estimate shows that cumulative net returns to

attending the elite university measured 15 years after graduation (the span of income data

for my sample) are equal to $120,000 (EUR 108,535).

Finally, approximately 40% of the observed unconditional diﬀerence in mean income

across universities is due to selection. In a policy perspective, this suggests that ranking

institutions according to graduates’ average income would substantially overestimate the

value added of attending elite universities.

Note: This ﬁgure shows the distribution of high school exit scores for students who applied to the elite
university (the sub-sample of individuals on which the regression discontinuity analysis is run) and those
that did not apply. The dotted line distribution represents students who applied to the elite university, while
the solid line represents those who did not apply. Since there are multiple cohorts of students attending
diﬀerent high schools in the data, the high school exit score was standardized by year of high school graduation
and school. The distribution for students applying to the elite university is substantially shifted to the right
(mean is 0.4 high school exit score standard deviations higher) and has lower variance.

A Technical Appendix - Numerical simulation for ex-

tending estimation to older cohorts

As explained in Section 3, data from admission oﬃce of the elite university have been matched

only for cohorts of students in my sample who graduated from high school between 1995 and

2005. For the cohorts of students graduating from high school between 1985 and 1994 I

know only partial admission information: I know which university they attended, their high

school exit score (that determines admission score with a weight of 50%), while I miss the

score obtained in the elite university admission test. Moreover I do not know which students

applied to the elite university but were not admitted.

In this appendix I describe the numerical simulation method used to combine partial

information for older cohorts with the complete data available for earlier cohorts to produce

estimates of returns to elite education for the full sample of cohorts graduating from high

school between 1985 and 2001. Since income is available for year 2005 only, pooling all

cohorts together not only substantially increases the number of observations, but also allows

to estimates returns for individuals that have spent up to 15 years on the labor market after

graduation.

Numerical simulation

Let i be the index for one of the 30,000 individuals in my sample graduating from high
t (1985(cid:54) t (cid:54) 2005) represents the year of high

school in Milan between 1985 and 2005.

school graduation for individual i and also the year in which i takes university admission

tests.

For each individual i I deﬁne four diﬀerent statuses deﬁning her/his relationship with the

elite university under study:

Appliedi: Indicator=1 if student i is observed applying to the elite university

Admittedi: Indicator=1 if student i is admitted at the elite university

54

Enrolledi: Indicator=1 if student i is observed enrolling in the elite university

Graduatedi: Indicator=1 if student i is observed graduating from elite university

Following the dataset structure I categorize individuals in ﬁve types:

1. Type 0000: (Appliedi=0; Admittedi=0; Enrolledi = 0; Graduatedi = 0) students

graduating from one of the high schools sampled in the data who did not apply at the

elite university and hence did not take the test.

2. Type 1000: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=0; Enrolledi = 0; Graduatedi = 0) students

applying at the elite university, but failed the test.

3. Type 1100: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=1; Enrolledi = 0; Graduatedi = 0) students

applying at the elite university who passed the test, but decided to enroll in a diﬀerent

university.

4. Type 1110: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=1; Enrolledi = 1; Graduatedi = 0) students

applying at the elite university who passed the test, enrolled at the elite university,

but dropped out from elite university.

5. Type 1111: (Appliedi=1; Admittedi=1; Enrolledi = 1; Graduatedi = 1) students

graduating from elite university.

The variables involved in the numerical simulation are deﬁned as follows:

yi: Logarithm of annual income observed in year 2005 for individual i

xhsi,t: High school exit score for individual i completing high school in year t (observed for

all cohorts in the sample)

xu

i,t: Elite university admission test score for individual i in admission session of year t

(observed for individuals applying to elite university after 1994, Appliedi=1)

xi,t = 1

55

∗: Admission threshold for admission session of year t such that individual i is admitted
xt

∗

For individuals i graduating in 1995≤ t ≤ 2005 all above variables are available.

For individuals i graduating in 1985≤ t <1995 I still observe xhsi,t, Enrolledi = 1,

Graduatedi = 1 and yi, but the following variables are missing: Appliedi, Admittedi, xu

i,t,

∗

xi,t, xt

The empirical issues arising from the absence of these variables for the older cohorts can

be summarized as follows:

Missing variable problem 1: I observe Enrolledi, Graduatedi. I do not observe Admittedi =
0. I can infer I(Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 1) and I(Admittedi = 1|Enrolledi = 1). I need to
estimate I(Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0)
Estimation step 1 : estimate P(Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0, xh
i,t, Pre college characteris-
tics Zi,t) for 1995≤ t ≤ 2005 and predict them out of sample to older individuals grad-
uating from high school in 1985≤ t ≤ 1994. Use

P (Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0, xh

(cid:92)

i,t, Zi)

as individual weights to draw B = 100 times a sample of individuals predicted as apply-

ing to elite university conditional on observing them not enrolling in the elite university:
Ib( (cid:92)Appliedi,b = 1|Enrolledi,b = 0) with b being each of 100 repetitions in the simulation.
What follows is also repeated at each repetition, however I drop the subscript b to keep

notation simple.

Missing variable problem 2: I do not observe university admission test score xu

i,t and as

a consequence the admission composite score xi,t determined for 50% by the admission test

score

Estimation step 2 : I use high school exit score xhs

i,t (which determines 50% of the overall ad-

56

mission score) as running variable for running my regression discontinuity at each repetition

b.

Missing variable problem 3: I do not observe the admission threshold x∗

t

Estimation step 3 : I pool the individuals predicted as applied at the elite university con-
ditional on observing them not enrolling I( (cid:92)Appliedi = 1|Enrolledi = 0) and those who are
observed enrolling Enrolledi = 1 for 1985≤ t ≤ 1994. For each t and for each possible

the probability of admission)

Once the control group of not admitted applicants to the elite university and admission

thresholds have been estimated for the older cohorts, at each repetition b I recombine the

data as follows. For cohorts graduating from high school after year t=1994 I keep the original

data with complete admission information. For older cohorts of students applying to elite

university between 1985 and 1994 I include individuals that have been observed enrolling at

the elite university as the treatment group and I take as the control group those individuals

predicted as not admitted applicants.

After pooling these three sub-smaples together at each repetition b of the numerical

simulation, I estimate my main regression discontinuity speciﬁcations:

The College Wage Premium
Jonathan James

The return on educational investments has risen substantially in the past 30 years. While the primary focus has been on 
the college wage premium, new evidence shows that the value of going to college is affected by a host of other impor-
tant educational decisions, each of which has a potentially large effect on future earnings. This Commentary examines 
the impact of two of these other decisions on earnings: the choice of a college major and the pursuit of an advanced 
degree. In some cases, differences in the college major premium are as large as the college wage premium itself.

It is well documented that college graduates earn signiﬁ cantly 
higher wages on average than those with only a high school 
diploma. The college wage premium has been a central 
focus for researchers because it is both large and growing. 
Current data indicate that college degree holders enjoy an 
84 percent increase in earnings over their high-school-
educated counterparts. 
Given this large disparity in earnings, some may argue that 
the greatest decision facing young people today is whether to 
go to (and complete) college. However, a growing literature 
has begun to suggest that the decision to go to college is just 
one of a sequence of educational investment decisions, each 
of which has a large effect on potential earnings. 
At the forefront of this literature is the choice of a college 
major. The availability of new data has highlighted the wide 
variation in wages across college majors, which in many 
cases is as large as the college wage premium itself. Addi-
tionally, advanced degrees yield a wage premium beyond 
what is awarded for a bachelor’s degree. This evidence 
implies that the gravity of the college decision is perhaps 
equally matched by the decisions one makes while in 
college as well as after college. 
This Commentary takes a more detailed look at the college 
wage premium, with a focus on how the premium is affected 
by these supplemental educational investment decisions. 
Two consequential decisions beside the college decision are 
discussed in particular: the choice of a college major and the 
pursuit of an advanced degree. 

 ISSN 0428-1276

Trends in the College Wage Premium
The college wage premium is calculated as the ratio of the 
median hourly wage for those holding a bachelor’s degree 
and the median hourly wage for those who have only 
completed high school. This statistic for full-time workers is 
plotted in ﬁ gure 1. These data show that the college wage 
premium increased rapidly through the 1980s and early 
part of the 1990s, rising from 40 percent to upwards of 
70 percent. Since the late 1990s, the premium has experienced 
a much slower rate of growth, drifting at times below and 
above 80 percent. Importantly though, the premium has 
persisted at historically high levels through the 2000s, 
becoming an enduring feature of the U.S. wage structure.

wages for those who have only completed high school. Data include workers who

Figure 1 also highlights the importance of college completion 
by showing the wage premium for those with only some 
college but lacking a four-year degree. The premium for 
these workers has experienced little to no growth over 
the last 30 years, where at the median they have about 
15 percent to 20 percent higher earnings.
Collectively, these results show that over the last three 
decades, the value of college has increased substantially, 
with all of the gains going to those who actually complete 
the four-degree.

Advanced Degree Premium
The standard assessment of the college wage premium is 
somewhat misleading because counted among four-year 
degree holders are those who also have an advanced 
degree. Including these individuals in the analysis may over-
state these returns, much in the same way that including high 
school dropouts in the high school graduate pool would. 
To study the inﬂ uence of including advanced degrees in the 
college premium calculation, ﬁ gure 2 plots the trend in the 
advanced degree premium, which is the ratio of median 
wages for those who hold a four-year degree and an advanced 
degree (6 plus years of college, a master’s degree, professional 
degree, or PhD) over those with only a bachelor’s degree. 
Looking from 1977 to the present, advanced degree earners 
have experienced growth in wages over and above those with 
only a four-year degree, from around 20 percent in the early 
1980s to around 30 percent today. 
To evaluate the effect of the four-year degree alone, 
advanced degree holders must be separated from the 
analysis. Figure 3 plots the wage premium for those with 
only a four-year degree and those who additionally have 
an advanced degree (both premiums are with respect to 
median wages of high school graduates). 

Even excluding advanced degree holders, the premium for 
a four-year degree alone remains extremely high at about 
60 percent. Interestingly, once the growth in wages for 
advanced degree holders is removed, the four-year degree 
premium has remained ﬂ at over the past decade. In other 
words, it is the growth in the value of advanced degrees that 
has accounted for all of the growth in the classical measure 
of the college wage premium since the 2000s.

Major Choice
Beginning in 2009 the American Community Survey (ACS), 
a large and nationally representative sample of the U.S. 
population, began collecting information on degree ﬁ eld 
for bachelor’s degree holders. Previous work studying the 
effect of the degree ﬁ eld on wages was conducted on much 
smaller samples and typically for only recent graduates. 
The availability of this information in the ACS has been an 
important resource because it yields high statistical power 
and is representative of the entire labor force.
The ACS separates four-year degree ﬁ elds into more than 
170 detailed categories. The detailed categories can be ag-
gregated into 15 broad categories to simplify the analysis. 
Using data from 2009 and 2010, ﬁ gure 4 plots the college 
four-year degree premium and the advanced degree premi-
um for each of these 15 aggregate categories. Figure 4 gives 
detail on the premiums as well as the proportion of four-
year degree holders in each ﬁ eld. The height of the brown 
bars shows the density of four-year degree holders in each 
area, and the height of the green bar shows the fraction in 
that major ﬁ eld who also hold an advanced degree. 
Figure 4 indicates that business (including economics) is 
by far the most popular ﬁ eld (since this is the bar with 
the largest height among the 15 categories). The largest 
fractions of advanced degree holders have BAs in either

education or business. However, this is due in large part to 
the fact that these two majors represent a signiﬁ cant share 
of the bachelor’s degree population. Perhaps more interest-
ing is to look at those ﬁ elds that have a high (or low) rate of 
advanced degree holding relative to their population. One 
example is biological and life science, where more than 
half of the four-year degree holders go on to receive an 
advanced degree. This is not surprising if this is the 
predominate undergraduate degree for medical doctors.
The college major choice has a potentially large effect on the 
value of a four-year degree. Comparing engineering majors, 
who have the highest four-year premium at 125 percent, to 
psychology and social work majors, who have the lowest 
premium at 40 percent, yields a difference in the college 
major premium of 85 percent, which is the same size as the 
traditional measure of the college wage premium.
Figure 5 breaks down the returns for the top 15 most popu-
lar detailed degree ﬁ elds. These ﬁ elds represent about 50 
percent of the degrees held by those with a bachelor’s 
degree. This chart shows again the large variance in returns 
by degree ﬁ eld as well as the large variation between simi-

larly deﬁ ned majors. For example, the aggregate category 
“business” from ﬁ gure 4 included degrees in business 
management and administration and ﬁ nance. Figure 5 
shows that ﬁ nance degree holders at the median have 
20 percent higher wages than those with a business 
management and administration degree. Of the 15 most 
popular majors, electrical engineering and computer 
science enjoy the highest premium for a four-year degree.
This evidence shows that the ﬁ eld of study has a large effect 
on potential earnings. Despite these large differences, it is 
important to acknowledge that at the median, there is a 
strong positive beneﬁ t for a four-year degree above a high 
school diploma, regardless of the degree ﬁ eld chosen.

Conclusion
Over the last three decades, the earnings of four-year degree 
holders have signiﬁ cantly outpaced the earnings of high 
school graduates and those with some college but lacking a 
college degree. The sharpest increases occurred during 
the 1980s and early 1990s, and though they have 
ﬂ attened somewhat in the recent decade, they still 
persist at a very high level.

The decision to go to college has a profound effect on 
wages; however, we have seen that both college major and 
the pursuit of an advanced degree have a critical impact 
on the value one receives from a college education as well. 
Other factors affecting the return to college not discussed 
here include college quality, occupational choices, hours 
worked, and the relevance of unobserved skills.

7,""Wage Premium From College Is Said to Be Up

By Shaila Dewan 

February 11, 2014 8:23 pm

The reason, they discovered, is that even though a college degree is worth more, a high
school degree alone is worth a lot less. Its value, in terms of wages, has declined enough to
cancel out almost all the gains by all the millennials who have earned four-year degrees.

From 1965 to 2013, according to a new Pew report called “The Rising Cost of Not

Going to College,” the typical high school graduate’s earnings fell more than 10 percent, after
inflation.

“That is one of the great economic stories of our era, which you could define as income

inequality,” said Paul Taylor, an author of the report. “The leading suspects are the digital
economy and the globalization of labor markets. Both of them place a higher premium on the
knowledge-based part of the work force and have the effect of drying up the opportunities for
good middle-class jobs, particularly for those that don’t have an education.”

Even middle-class jobs that are still available increasingly require a college degree,

either because they require more skill than they used to or because employers have become
pickier.

The Pew report found that the wage premium for having a college degree was at a

record high. The median annual wage for young college-educated workers now is $45,500,
compared to $28,000 for high school graduates — a gap of $17,500. In 1965, the gap was
much smaller: $7,400. (All the figures are in 2012 dollars.)

Not surprisingly, in a survey conducted by Pew, young college graduates were more

likely to report satisfaction with their careers. “On virtually every measure of economic well-
being and career attainment — from personal earnings to job satisfaction to the share
employed full time — young college graduates are outperforming their peers with less
education,” said the report, which included economic data from the United States Census in
the analysis of the survey results.

The value of a college degree is well established, but the high cost of tuition and fees
has made many question whether it is worth the investment. Most young college graduates
surveyed by Pew said their degree had already paid off or would pay off, even though many
are saddled with debt. In the survey, 66 percent of millennials said they had borrowed to pay
for school, compared to 59 percent of Gen Xers, those aged 33 to 48, and 43 percent of baby
boomers, ages 49 to 67.

“For today’s young adults, the only thing more expensive than going to college is not
going to college,” Mr. Taylor said. “And that sort of captures the dilemma that many find
themselves in.”

8,""Eroding Returns in College Education
by FRED SIEGMUND

Tweet

Share

A good financial return for a college education should not be assumed as it
once was. Chances remain high that college will pay, but changes in tuition
and labor markets are lowering the return and raising the risk it might not pay
for all graduates. Higher and higher tuition, delays finding jobs and the course
of study head a list of trouble spots to consider when making a college
investment.

Tuition

All the states have one and usually two public universities that offer the best
opportunity to measure tuition inflation. Private colleges tend to have higher
tuition than public colleges, but they are more likely to offer discounts to
attract good students away from the less expensive public colleges.
Competition for good students means the posted tuition at private colleges
may not be a good measure of actual tuition paid, or its rate of increase.
Public colleges are less likely to discount tuition than private colleges, which
makes them a better measure of tuition increases.

Compare the 2002 tuition for the two largest state universities in each of the
fifty states with the tuition of 2013. Some like the University of Arizona have
tuition increases at rates that range up to five times the rate of inflation. For
example, if the 2002 tuition of $2,490 at the University of Arizona increased
by the rate of inflation until 2013, it would be $3,224.80. Instead it is $10,391,
an increase of 317.31 percent, which is an annual compounded increase of
13.87 percent when the general inflation rate was 2.38 percent in the same
years. (1)

The high percentage increase at the University of Arizona results partly from
its relatively low 2002 tuition. The lower 2002 tuition exaggerates the
percentage increase over the period but I can find 31 state colleges out of the
hundred that have higher tuition than the University of Arizona. Take the
University of Vermont. If its 2002 tuition of $8,994 increased by the rate of
inflation until 2013, it would be $11,648.13. Instead it is $15,718, an increase
of 74.76 percent, which is a annual compounded percent increase of 5.21
percent, one of the lower rates of increase of tuition for the 100 colleges
reviewed.

All of the hundred colleges mentioned above had tuition increases higher than
the 2.38 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. All but seven had
increases at least twice the rate of inflation; forty-nine had tuition increases at
least three times the rate of inflation.

Wages

Wage for jobs that need BA degree skills need to go up as fast as tuition to
avoid lowering the rate of return on a college education. The Bureau of Labor

Statistics (BLS) identifies occupations and careers that need BA degree
skills. (2)

In 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 169 occupations that require
BA degree skills with a combined 20.5 million jobs. The total includes 93
occupations with 10 million jobs that had a median wage increase above the
inflation rate of 2.38 percent from 2002 to 2013. The median increase of the
median wage for the 93 occupations was 2.9 percent. There were 32
occupations with 6.8 million jobs that had a median wage increase less than
the inflation rate. The median increase of the median wage for the 32
occupations was 2.0 percent.

The remaining 44 occupations of the 169 do not have corresponding median
wage data for 2013 because some occupations were defined in broader
categories in 2002. For example, a nurse in 2002 was broken into four
occupations in 2013: Registered Nurse, Nurse Anesthetists, Nurse Midwives,
and Nurse Practitioners. Hence wage data is not reported for both years for 44
occupations that have 3.7 million jobs.

In sum, only three of the hundred colleges reviewed had tuition increases less
than 4 percent a year, while only seven occupations of the 125 with data had
median wage increases as high as four percent, and four of the seven were
management occupations. The combination of tuition and wage changes over
time assures a general decline in the rate of return on a BA degree.

Measuring the Decline

A few calculations help measure the decline. Someone entering the University
of Arizona in 2002 had to pay $2,490 for a year’s tuition. At the time student
loan interest was set at 4.06 percent. Using the 4.06 interest rate the total four-
year investment would be $11,012.82 assuming tuition is paid in the fall and
compounded once a year. [Computations are courtesy of the Excel FV
spreadsheet function. Entries for the $11,012.82 are FV(.0406/1, 4, -$2,409, 0
,1). ]

Someone graduating at age 22 in 2006 has 44 years to work and earn a return
on the investment. If the $11,012.82 was invested in stocks and bonds and
earned a 4.06 percent return over the 44 years it would be $65,525.86. To
have the equivalent $65,525.86 because of a better job requiring college
degree skills, it will be necessary to earn an extra $44.64 a month for the same
44 years. [Excel entries for the $65,525.86 are FV(.0406/12, 528, 0,
-$11,012.82 ,1) and so on.]

Any amount above $44.64 and the return is above 4.06 percent. If the amount
was $100 a month for 44 years the return would be 10.9 percent, a return
higher than most long term stock returns or student loans.

However, compare that to what happens to someone entering the University
of Arizona in 2013 when a year’s tuition jumped to $10,391. In the time
between 2002 and 2013 the interest on college student loans has gyrated from
a low of 3.4 to a high of 6.8 percent, but it was set at 3.86 percent for the
2013-2014 academic year. Using a 3.86 interest rate the total four-year
investment will be $45,732.76, again assuming tuition is paid in the fall and
compounded once a year.

If the $45,732.76 was invested in stocks and bonds and earned a 3.86 percent
return over 44 years, as above, it would be $249,258.16. To have the
equivalent $249,258.16 because of a better job requiring college degree skills,
it will be necessary to earn an extra $179.58 a month for 44 years, a little over
four times $44.64.

Any amount above $179.58 and the return will be greater than 3.86 percent,
but any amount below $179.58 and the return is lower. If the amount was
$100 as it was above the return drops to a paltry .67 percent.

Risk

Rapidly rising tuition during a period of stagnant wages has not slowed the
tied of graduates. The number of working age adults with BA degrees keeps
growing because current graduates are more than double the graduates from
the 1970’s who are reaching retirement age. BA degree graduates total 48.7
million from June 1971 until the end of the academic year in 2012. If the two
years yet to be reported have at least the same number as 2012, as seems
likely, then 52.3 million working age adults have BA degrees. (3)

Some of the 52.3 million with BA degrees went on to get master’s degrees,
doctorates and professional degrees. Subtracting the graduate and professional
degrees from the total still leaves 28.2 million working age adults with BA
degrees to fill the 20.5 million jobs in 2013 that need BA degree skills.

The growing number of people with BA degree skills raises the risk of delay
to find higher wage career employment. Compare what happens with 10 years
of delay. If the tuition was invested in stocks and bonds and earned 3.86

percent for 10 more years it would grow to $67,235.10. If the $67,235.10 was
invested in stocks and bonds and earned a 3.86 percent return over 34 years, it
would also be $249,258.16 as above. To have the equivalent $249,258.16
because of a better job for 34 years, it will be necessary to earn an extra
$295.21 a month, more than six times the $44.64 from above. An additional
$100 a month would be a negative return that would not earn the initial
investment.

The chances remain good that college will pay, but individual decisions matter
more than ever. I can find 65 occupations in the Occupational Employment
Survey requiring no more than high school skills with employment just over
11 million people that have a median wage greater than $50,000. I expect
some of the people in those jobs have college degrees, but it is likely their
tuition money would be earning a higher return in the stock market. Allow me
to repeat, a good financial return for a college education should not be
assumed.

W ith signs pointing to persistent high unemployment and a recovery even weaker than those of the early 

1990s and 2000s, it is becoming common to hear in the media and among some policy makers the claim 
that lingering unemployment is not cyclical but “structural.” In this story, the jobs problem is not a lack of 
demand for workers but rather a mismatch between workers’ skills and employers’ needs. Another version of the skills 
mismatch is also being told about the future: we face an impending skills shortage, particularly a shortfall of college 
graduates, after the economy returns to full employment.
 
 The common aspect of each of these claims about 
structural problems is that education is the solution, the 
only solution. In other words, delivering the appropriate 
education and training to workers becomes the primary if 
not sole policy challenge if we hope to restore full employ-
ment in the short and medium term and if we expect to 
prevent a (further) loss of competitiveness and a further 
rise in wage and income inequality in the longer term.
There are ample reasons to be skeptical of both claims:

suggest—fueling the rise of long-term unemployment 
in this recession. If there has been some transforma-
tion of the workplace leaving millions of workers 
inadequate for the currently available jobs, then it was 
not based on a major educational upscaling of jobs.

The challenge the nation faces as high unemployment 
persists is not better education and training for those 
currently unemployed. The problem is a lack of jobs. 

The huge increase in wage and income inequality 
experienced over the last 30 years is not a reflection of 
a shortfall in the skills and education of the workforce. 
Rather, workers face a wage deficit, not a skills deficit. 
It is hard to find some ever-increasing need for college 
graduates that is going unmet: college graduates have 
not seen their real wage rise in 10 years, and the pay 
gap with high school graduates has not increased in 
that time period. Moreover, even before the recession 
college students and graduates were working as free 
interns, a phenomenon we would not observe if college 
graduates were in such demand. 

In the following I do not present definitive evidence, but I 
hope to be persuasive enough for readers to demand more 
evidence before accepting either of these claims of imme-
diate structural employment problems or long-term skills 
deficits.  The  first  section  draws  heavily  on  recent  work 
on structural unemployment in the current recession (see 
Mishel et al. 2010), and the second draws heavily on the 
wages chapter of the most recent version of The State of 
Working America (Mishel et al. 2009). 

i. is current unemployment  
    primarily structural in nature?

The context
Unemployment  has  remained  at  9.5%  or  above    since 
mid-2009 and may remain that high or inch even higher 
through 2011. The predominant narrative to describe this 
situation has been that the bursting of the housing and 
stock bubbles and the financial crisis led to a severe cut-
back in household consumption and business investment, 
causing  severe  job  losses.  The  policy  conclusion  drawn 

from this narrative is that we need faster growth to increase 
the demand for workers and reduce unemployment.
 
A  competing  and,  in  my  view,  misguided  narrative 
has also been put forth that a large share of current high 
unemployment  is  structural,  meaning  that  those  who 
are unemployed are not well suited to the jobs becoming 
available. This would be, for instance, because their skills 
are  inadequate,  have  deteriorated,  or  are  not  applicable 
to  the  industries  that  are  expanding,  or  because  the  
unemployed simply do not live where the jobs are. Some 
make  claims  about  structural  unemployment  because 
certain  aggregate  relationships,  such  as  that  between  
job openings and unemployment, do not appear to be 
following historical patterns, thereby suggesting a possible 
skills  mismatch.  Others  have  postulated  that  employers 
have substantially revamped their production processes in 
this downturn, thereby eliminating the need for many of 
the types of workers who are currently unemployed. Still 
others note that the housing bubble led to a bloated con-
struction sector, and many of those jobs will never come 
back; displaced construction workers must switch to new 
jobs for which they may not be qualified. The policy im-
plications of a finding that high unemployment is primarily 
structural are that: (1) it would be foolhardy to use further 
demand management (fiscal stimulus, either tax cuts or 
increased spending, or monetary policy) to lower unem-
ployment, and (2) the appropriate policy is to offer educa-
tion and training to the unemployed to help them make a 
transition to new occupations and sectors.
 
Yet there has been little evidence offered to support 
the claim of extensive structural unemployment, and we 
find  that  the  pattern  of  employer  behavior  regarding 
job openings, layoffs, and hires does not lend it much 
credence. This matters quite a bit for guiding policy. 
 
Lest I be accused of critiquing a straw man, note the 
recent statement of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank 
president, Narayana Kocherlakota (2010):

What  does  this  change  in  the  relationship  be-
tween job openings and unemployment connote? 
In a word, mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t 
find  appropriate  workers.  The  workers  want  to 
work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 2

many possible sources of mismatch—geography, 
skills,  demography—and  they  are  probably  all 
at work. Whatever the source, though, it is hard 
to see how the Fed can do much to cure this 
problem. Monetary stimulus has provided con-
ditions so that manufacturing plants want to hire 
new workers. But the Fed does not have a means 
to transform construction workers into manufac-
turing workers. 
  Of course, the key question is: How much 
of the current unemployment rate is really due 
to mismatch, as opposed to conditions that the 
Fed can readily ameliorate? The answer seems to 
be  a  lot.  Most  of  the  existing  unemployment 
represents mismatch that is not readily amenable 
to monetary policy.

The competing explanation, as mentioned above, is the 
one I find most plausible: the economy is operating far 
below  its  potential  output  because  of  a  shortfall  in 
demand caused by an extreme loss of financial and housing 
wealth  that  caused  consumption  to  fall;  thus,  there  are 
simply not enough jobs to go around. Evidence for this 
explanation focuses on such indicators as low operating 
capacity  in  manufacturing,  which  was  71.6%  in  June 
2010, down from 79.1% in December 2007. Vacancies 
in  commercial  offices  (now  at  17.4%)  are  further  indi-
cation of excess capacity. The bottom line is that total 
demand in the second quarter of 2010 was still below its 
pre-recession level. In fact, total output, as measured by 
gross domestic product, was 1.3% below its pre-recession 
level. Of course, one would expect demand and output 
to have grown substantially over the two-and-a-half years 
since the official start of the recession and the ensuing 
recovery. The Congressional Budget Office conservatively 
puts  the  “output  gap,”  the  difference  between  potential 
and actual output, at 6.4% in the second quarter.1 I think 
the output gap is larger, probably about 9.0% (derived by 
multiplying 4.5% excess unemployment by 2, from the 
usual Okun gap formula). 
In my view, the pervasiveness of (1) lost employment 
  
and  output  across  sectors  and  (2)  high  unemployment 
across types of workers by state, education, age, and occupa-
tion suggests an aggregate or macroeconomic explanation 

rather  than  one  rooted  in  a  few  sectors  or  locations  or 
because some workers lack skills. 

skepticism appropriate
The claim that current unemployment is primarily struc-
tural should require much more evidence than has been 
offered because common sense would deny such an expla-
nation. The structural unemployment story presumes that 
millions  of  workers  are  now  inadequately  prepared  for 
available jobs even though they were fruitfully employed 
just a few months or years ago. The argument raises a few 
key questions.

Has there been a major shift in  
productivity or technology investment?
What footprints would lead us to believe that the economy 
transformed itself from the end of 2007 to the beginning 
of 2010, leaving millions of workers inadequate? Produc-
tivity did grow a pretty spectacular 6.3% from early 2009 
to  early  2010,  but  that  was  the  extent  of  productivity 
growth since the recession started in late 2007.2 Net in-
vestment  in  business  equipment  and  software  in  2009 
(the latest data) was actually negative, the first time this 
occurred since World War II.3 Thus, the alleged structural 
transformation  of  production  processes  that  left  4-5% 
of  the  labor  force  inadequate  for  the  available  jobs  was 
clearly not associated with new equipment or new techno-
logical processes (requiring software), leaving us doubtful 
it happened at all.

Have the jobs moved around? 
Is  the  problem  just  a  need  for  greater  mobility,  for  the 
unemployed  to  move  to  where  jobs  are  more  plentiful? 
Well,  where  would  they  go?  There  are  11  states  with  a 
total adult population of about 17 million where the un-
employment rate in June was less than 7.0%.4 There are 
not enough jobs in those states to matter much, and if 
the unemployed moved to those states they would nearly 
double the labor force there. 

Is unemployment unusually high  
compared to job openings?
The “Beveridge curve” describes the historical relationship 
between unemployment and job openings, and allows one 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 3

to predict how high or low the unemployment rate should 
be given a certain number of job openings. There has been 
much attention to the mid-July blog post by David Altig 
(2010a), senior vice president and research director at the 
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, who used such an analysis 
to  suggest  that  almost  a  third  of  the  unemployed,  4.6 
million workers, are structurally unemployed. His claim 
was  based  solely  on  a  simple  analysis  of  job  openings 
and  unemployment  since  2000  that  encompassed  the 
experiences  of  just  two  recessions.  Less  noticed  is  that 
Altig (2010b)  retreated  from  this  claim  just  a  month 
later,  following  an  analysis  by  Cleveland  Federal  Re-
serve  economists  Murat Tasci  and  John  Lindner  (Tasci 
and Lindner 2010). Those authors,  using data back to 
1951, showed that unemployment higher than what the 
Beveridge curve would suggest is not “anomalous”: rather, 
it  happened  in  the  initial  recoveries  following  the  deep 
recessions in the 1970s and 1980s as well. 

looking for evidence 
on the employer side
One of the curious aspects of this developing structural 
unemployment storyline is how hard it is to find any re-
search  tying  this  hypothesis  to  actual  detailed  trends  in 
employment, unemployment, or output data. This section 
explores patterns on the demand side, such as employer 
job openings, layoffs, and hiring, to see if they correspond 
to a structural unemployment story. 

The number of job openings
The job seekers ratio, which is the number of unemployed 
workers per job opening, provides ample evidence of a 
demand  side  problem.  Simply  put,  the  number  of  job 
openings  has  been  far  too  few  to  accommodate  those 
looking for work.
 
As Figure A shows, the ratio of unemployed to job 
openings  surpassed  six  in  the  summer  of  2009  but  has

Months into recovery

dropped to the low five range more recently (once jobs to 
conduct the 2010 Census were filled). Even if the unem-
ployed filled every job opening there would still remain 
many unemployed workers, an indication of too few job 
openings.5 The ratio of the unemployed to job openings 
in recent months has been nearly double that attained at 
the worst points of the early 2000s recession, a ratio of 
2.8, which is not surprising since total job openings in the 
last half of 2009 were 25% below those in mid-2003. 
  We can examine this phenomenon further by com-
paring the cumulative number of job openings in the first 
12 months of the last recovery to the first 12 months of 
this one.
 
Figure B shows that the cumulative job openings in 
this recovery’s first year were about 32.0 million, roughly 
10.0 million fewer than the cumulative openings in the 

early 2000s recovery. Recall that the recovery of the early 
2000s is known as a “jobless recovery,” as the economy 
shed an additional 600,000 jobs after the recession had 
ended. Yet the current recovery has generated far fewer job 
openings than that pitifully weak recovery.
 
Job openings by industrial sector. A shortfall in job 
openings is clear, yet a concentration of this shortfall in a 
few specific industries such as construction would provide 
evidence of a structural shift. 
 
Figure C shows the ratio in each sector of the cumula-
tive job openings in the current recovery to those in the 
early 2000s recovery. This measure shows how far short 
this  recovery’s  job  openings  are  relative  to  those  of  the 
earlier  recovery  for  each  sector. The  shortfall  in  job 
openings  is  pervasive,  occurring  in  every  sector  (except 
mining). Recent openings averaged 72% of those in the

earlier  recovery.  Recent  construction  job  openings  were 
indeed just 58% of those in the earlier recovery, but the 
shortfall in job openings was also severe in labor-intensive 
service industries such as hospitality, entertainment, and 
accommodation. Since the trends are pervasive across all 
sectors, it is time to stop thinking about unemployment 
and the failure to generate job openings as a circumstance 
driven by developments in particular sectors.
 
Table 1, which shows the job opening data for each 
sector in both the 2001 and 2007 recoveries, allows an 
assessment of the scale of the recent openings shortfall by 
sector. Construction is responsible for 5.7% of the recent 
shortfall,  but  that  is  comparable  to  that  sector’s  5.5% 
share  of  employment;  in  other  words,  construction  has 

not played any outsized role in the failure for openings 
to rise as fast now as in the earlier recovery. The shortfall 
has  predominately  been  driven  by  private  service-sector 
industries (professional and business services, health, edu-
cation, entertainment, hospitality, and accommodations), 
which  generated  71%  of  the  openings  shortfall  despite 
having just 46% of total employment. In fact, the worst 
performing industry under this measure was leisure and 
hospitality, which accounts for 10% of employment but 
18% of the job openings shortfall.

The number of job losses
Maybe the issue is that we have been seeing more struc-
tural changes within industries or shifts across industries

that are leading to more layoffs, thereby impeding growth 
in overall employment. A look at the cumulative layoffs 
in this recovery compared to the last recovery, as in 
Figure D, shows that layoffs are not a piece that fills in 
any puzzle: the cumulative layoffs in each recovery are 
totally comparable.

Filling job openings
Last, we examine whether it is harder to fill job openings, 
an  indication  that  structural  challenges  such  as  having 
workers with the right skills or in the right locations are 
evident. The data for the private sector, however, show it 
is easier to hire people now than in the last recovery or 
earlier in this recession, at least as reflected in the ratio of 
hires per job opening.

 
If  it  is  difficult  to  hire  adequately  skilled  workers 
it should take longer to fill vacancies, and the ratio of 
hires to openings should fall. In fact, as Figure E shows, 
the opposite has occurred: the ratio has been somewhat 
higher  in  this  recovery  (averaging  1.7  hires  per  job 
opening) relative to the earlier recovery (1.5 hires per job 
opening).6 Moreover, this ratio has increased since the 
recession started, which means there is no evidence of a 
growing structural problem. Remember, too, how these 
data are timed. “Job openings” is the count of available 
jobs on the last day of the month. “Hires,” on the other 
hand, is the sum of all hires completed throughout the 
month. As long as the number of hires is larger than the 
number of openings, it is taking less than a month to fill 
those jobs.

looking for evidence  
on the employee side
The analysis now turns to an examination of the charac-
teristics of the unemployed, especially the increase in un-
employment, to see whether those who are unemployed 
are  not  well  matched  to  the  available  jobs.  Since  those 
making  the  claim  that  there  is  severe  structural  unem-
ployment have not presented any evidence about workers 
themselves—relying simply on the extent of overall un-
employment—it is difficult to identify how to test their 
claim. However, it seems reasonable to assume that workers 
who are “inadequate” for current jobs would tend to have 
less  education,  be  stuck  in  declining  industries,  and  be 
older. To gauge whether this is the case the analysis that 
follows  focuses  on  how  the  composition  of  unemploy-

ment  and  long-term  unemployment  has  changed  since 
2007. That is, the analysis explores who (which type of 
worker) fueled the rise in unemployment and long-term 
unemployment.
 
The construction industry
Much of the intuitive appeal of the structural unemploy-
ment claim is that the recession came because of the bursting 
of the housing bubble and the consequent shrinking of the 
construction sector. In this view, many unskilled workers 
who benefited from the expansion of the construction 
sector have been forced to find new types of work, pre-
sumably a difficult transition to make. I will not comment 
on the notion that construction workers are “unskilled,” 
which  can  easily  be  refuted  by  an  examination  of  their

wages  and  benefits  and  the  training  needed  for  jobs  in 
this sector: this is plainly a judgment on “skill” set by the 
fact that workers in this sector do not necessarily need to 
have a college education or an advanced degree. Rather 
let us turn to what we know about unemployment in this 
sector. A minor foray into labor market data suggests that 
construction does not play the outsized role imagined by 
the president of the Minnesota Federal Reserve Bank and 
many other commentators. It is true that construction has 
lost nearly two million jobs in this downturn, 25% of all 
private sector jobs lost. But is this what has fueled growing 
unemployment? The answer is no. In the second quarter of 
2010 (Figure F) unemployed construction workers made 
up 12.4 % of the unemployed and 12.5% of the long-term 

unemployed:  this  means  that  unemployed  construction 
workers are not more likely to be long-term unemployed 
than those displaced from other sectors. Even before the 
recession, in 2007, unemployed construction workers were 
10.6%  of  all  unemployed  and  11.0%  of  the  long-term 
unemployed. This means that the composition of unem-
ployment and long-term unemployment has barely shifted 
toward construction workers. Just because there was an ex-
treme loss of jobs in construction does not imply that those 
workers  are  driving  up  unemployment.  More  research  is 
needed to determine what happened to those workers dis-
placed from construction, but it is apparent that many have 
found jobs in other sectors, and perhaps some of the immi-
grant workers in this sector have left the country.

The composition of unemployment
Table 2 provides a breakdown of unemployment by edu-
cation level, based on published BLS data for those ages 
25 and over (this group has presumably completed its 
education). The data are presented for the last quarter of 
the previous recovery to give an indication of the com-
position of unemployment before the recession. Data are 
also  presented  for  the  most  recent  quarter  (the  second 
quarter of 2010) and for that same quarter in 2009. This 
allows us to examine the changes over the entire recession 
and over the last year, a period where the Beveridge curve 
analyses are said to suggest a growing mismatch between 
the  skills  of  the  unemployed  and  those  needed  for  job 
openings. What is most apparent from Table 2, however, 
is that the composition of unemployment has remained 
remarkably stable throughout this period. Workers with 

less education have higher unemployment rates at every 
point in the business cycle, but the unemployment rate 
has more than doubled for every education group over the 
downturn. Unemployment rose for each education group 
in the last year  except the least-educated—those lacking 
a high school degree—a finding not very supportive of a 
recent twist against the least-educated workers.
  The second panel presents the composition of unem-
ployment by education level, and the trends do not support 
any notion of this recession’s higher unemployment being 
fueled by those with the least education. The share of the 
unemployed with bachelor’s degrees or more is the same 
in the most recent quarter as before the recession. Those 
with some college have seen their share of unemployment 
bumped  up  slightly. These  two  groups  make  up  the 
upper  61% of the labor force by education, and their

share of unemployment has not fallen. One might even 
imagine  that  our  expectation  is  that  those  with  more 
education saw their share decline in a recession. Further 
analysis  along  these  lines,  looking  at  earlier  recessions, 
would be useful.
 
Table 3 provides data on the rise in the unemployment 
rates by demographic group, including by education, for 
those ages 16 and over. The table also provides information 
on the long-term unemployment of each group: the share 
of the labor force that is long-term unemployed (27 weeks 
or more) and the share of the unemployed of each group 
that is unemployed long term. Data are presented for two 
time periods, the last half of both 2007 and 2009. These 
data are computed from the microdata and therefore are 
not seasonally adjusted, and so we make comparisons to 
similar time periods of the year.
 
Between  these  two  periods  the  unemployment  rate 
more  than  doubled,  up  4.9  percentage  points  to  9.5%. 
As  we  saw  in  the  previous  table,  unemployment  rose 

sharply  for  every  education  group.  With  these  data 
we can separately examine those with a bachelor’s degree 
and those with advanced degrees and see that those with 
at  most  a  college  degrees  saw  their  unemployment  rate 
rise (up 119%) as fast as or faster than those with a high 
school degree or less. It does appear that older workers saw 
their unemployment rate rise disproportionately relative 
to younger workers (those ages 16 to 24), consistent with 
possible structural unemployment. Along these same lines 
it is true that the oldest workers had the highest share of 
long-term unemployed among the unemployed of their 
group (45.9%). 
  The  biggest  strike  against  the  structural  unemploy-
ment  claim  is  that  every  education  group  has  a  similar 
share  of  its  unemployment  as  long-term  unemployed. 
Therefore, it seems that all workers once they are unem-
ployed have a similar probability of being unemployed for 
at least 27 weeks regardless of their education level. That 
means that there is no particular education skew fueling

the rise of long-term unemployment, just as we saw with 
overall  unemployment  in  the  previous  table.  If  there 
has  been some transformation of the workplace leaving 
millions of workers inadequate for the currently available 
jobs, as the structural unemployment claim would venture, 
then  this  transformation  was  definitely  not  based  on 
a major educational upscaling of jobs, or at least that is 
what the unemployment data are telling us. 
 
It is also clear that black workers suffer by far the most 
from long-term unemployment, with 6.7% of the black 
labor force affected. Blacks have an even larger share of 

the long-term unemployed than the whole group of those 
lacking a high school degree, even though the vast majority 
of the black labor force has a high school degree or further 
education. This finding, however, sheds no particular in-
sight into the structural unemployment claim.

Conclusion on current  
structural unemployment
We increasingly hear or read claims that we have a serious 
structural unemployment problem, even to the extent of 
claiming that most of the unemployed beyond a normal 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 12

(full-employment) rate face structural problems in finding 
work. This argument implies that unemployment diffi-
culties reside in the workers who are unemployed: they 
either are located in the wrong place or do not have the 
required  skills  for  the  currently  available  jobs.  If  this 
is  so,  then  macroeconomic  tools  such  as  fiscal  policy 
(spending or tax cuts) or monetary policy cannot address 
our unemployment or long-term unemployment situa-
tion.  But  surprisingly,  perhaps  amazingly,  there  is  no 
systematic empirical evidence for such assertions. Before 
policy  makers  adopt  this  framework—that  much  of 
our unemployment is “structural”—they should require 
much more evidence than is currently available. This is 
especially the case because common sense would suggest 
that the problem faced by the unemployed is a scarcity 
of  job  openings,  a  feature  of  the  labor  market  facing 
every group of workers regardless of education, sector, 
occupation, and location.

ii. is there a looming shortage of  
      college-educated workers?
The second structural issue to examine in the labor market 
is the claim that the economy faces a looming shortage of 
college graduates that, if not addressed, will cause flagging 
competitiveness and further growth in wage and income 
inequality. A related claim is that the rise in wage inequality 
over the last 30 years or so can be traced primarily to a 
technology-driven shift toward a greater need for “more 
educated” and skilled workers—i.e., college graduates—
that  was  not  met  by  a  corresponding  increase  in  the 
supply of college graduates. This is not necessarily a short-
age we face in the next few years, according to some leading 
economists,  but  one  we  will  face  when  the  economy 
returns to full employment. 
 
In response to a question posed by The Economist, “Is 
America facing an increase in structural unemployment?” 
MIT economist Daron Acemoglu wrote an article, “Yes, 
the labour force hasn’t responded to shifting demand for 
skills” (Acemoglu 2010). He wrote:

US structural unemployment is up. But this is 
not a recent turn of events. It is the continua-
tion  of  an  ongoing  process….US  employment 
and  demand  for  labour  have  been  undergoing 

profound changes over the last 30 years. While 
the  demand  for  high  skill  workers,  who  can 
perform  complex,  often  non-production  tasks, 
has  increased,  manufacturing  jobs  and  other 
“middling  occupations”  have  been  in  decline. 
Also noteworthy is that over the last 10-15 years, 
many relatively low-skill, low-pay service occupa-
tions have been expanding rapidly.

David  Autor  (2010),  another  MIT  economist  and  a 
co-author  with  Acemoglu  of  important  papers  on  this 
topic, recently wrote a paper for the Hamilton Project 
and the Center for American Progress saying:

Although the U.S. labor market will almost surely 
rebound  from  the  Great  Recession,  this  paper 
presents  a  somewhat  disheartening  picture  of 
its  longer-term  evolution.  Rising  demand  for 
highly educated workers, combined with lagging 
supply, is contributing to higher levels of earnings 
inequality.  Demand  for  middle-skill  jobs  is 
declining,  and  consequently,  workers  that  do 
not obtain postsecondary education face a con-
tracting set of job opportunities.

The  policy  implications  of  this  impending  skills  short-
age, according to Autor, are that “an increased supply of  
college graduates should eventually help to drive down the 
college wage premium and limit the rise in inequality,” and 
“the United States should foster improvements in K-12 
education so that more people will be prepared to go on to 
higher education.” Moreover, we need “training programs 
to boost skill levels and earnings opportunities in histori-
cally low-skilled service jobs—and more broadly, to offer 
programs  for  supporting  continual  learning,  retraining, 
and mobility for all workers.” In short, the U.S. needs 
to  create  many  more  college  graduates  and  to  provide 
various  types  of  training  for  those  who  do  not  become 
college graduates.
 
But the need to vastly boost the total number of college 
graduates in the future may not be as great as Autor and 
Acemoglu believe. For instance, the trends in the 2000s 
indicate that the relative demand for college graduates is 
growing much more slowly than in prior decades. Plus, 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 13

the wages for college graduates have been flat for about 
10 years and running parallel to those with high school 
degrees, and they have been growing far more slowly than 
productivity. The implication of these trends is that a surge 
of college graduates, whatever the benefits (and there are 
many), can be expected to drive the college wage down. 
Wage inequality would diminish, but by pressing college 
graduate wages down (not just in relative terms), which is 
not the picture frequently painted of the future.
 
It is important to note that when we discuss the em-
ployment or wages of “college graduates” we refer to those 
with a four-year degree but no further degree; i.e., we ex-
clude both those with advanced or “professional” degrees and 
those with associate college degrees or with “some college” 
but no degree past high school. This definition is important 
because  the  trends  for  the  aggregate  group  of  all  those 
with  a  college  degree,  including  those  with  advanced 
degrees, is always far more favorable than trends among 
those with at most a bachelor’s degree. For instance, in 

2009 the unemployment rate among all college graduates 
was 4.6%, but those with at most a bachelor’s degree had 
a rate of 5.2% and those with advanced degrees had a rate 
of 3.4%. There are also very different wage trends among 
those with only bachelor’s degrees (not so good) and those 
with advanced degrees (much better). And so it is not sur-
prising that analyses which look at the aggregate college 
group would recommend a vast increase in the supply of 
college graduates, but in reality what the trends mean is 
that we need more people with advanced degrees, not just 
college degrees. It is important to distinguish these groups 
so we are clear about the findings and implications.
 
Remarkably, few people seem to know how the work-
force breaks down across these categories, and so we have 
illustrated them in Table 4. Note that about 21% of those 
employed have at most a bachelor’s degree, and another 
10% have an advanced degree. Only 6.1% of non-immi-
grant employed workers lack a high school degree (or do 
not have a GED). A small group, roughly 10%, have an

associate’s college degree, but an even larger group, about 
20%,  has  attended  college  but  has  no  degree  past  high 
school; this group is labeled “some college.”
 
As  we  have  argued  in  great  detail  in  The  State  of 
Working America (Mishel et al. 2009) and in other studies 
dating back to 1994 (with my frequent co-author, Jared 
Bernstein) technological change and unmet needs for skill 
have had little to do with the growth of wage inequality 
over the last 30 years. This is not to say that there hasn’t 
been  an  increased  employer  demand  for  workers  with 
more skills and more education: that has been happening 
for at least a century. What this means is that the growing 
need for “education” has been met with a growing supply. 
For  instance,  between  1973  and  2007  the  share  of  the 
workforce with bachelor’s degrees and advanced degrees 
has  doubled,  from  about  10%  of  the  workforce  with  a 
bachelor’s degree and 4.5% with an advanced degree.
Regardless of the pressures or lack of them from the 
 
labor  market,  it  would  be  a  very  positive  thing  to  give 
every student who wants to obtain a college education a 
real chance—resources and the appropriate education in 
K-12—to attend and complete college, even if this drives 
down the college wage. One could argue that the issue 
facing the nation is not so much the need to vastly increase 
the number of college graduates but to give broader 
access to the asset of a completed college education. While 
employer demand is not booming so much that we need 
to vastly boost college graduation—it will continue to 
expand at a rate fast enough to satisfy employer needs—
it  may  be  the  case  that  moving  forward  we  will  have  a 
challenge to generate enough college graduates because we 
will be exhausting the traditional sources of their supply, 
the white middle  and upper classes. (That is an avenue of 
research the author expects to pursue.)
 
Furthermore, it is still certainly the case that com-
pleting college will put a person in a better position in 
the workplace relative to someone who has less education, 
at  least  on  average.  And  there  are  clear  non-economic 
benefits as well, from enjoying better health to being a 
more  informed  citizen.  Going  to  college  will  not  be  a 
guarantee of a certain type of income or even access to 
certain employer benefits—recent college graduates (not 
just during the recession) earn less in their mid-twenties 
than those who graduated in the late 1990s, and they 

are far less likely to have jobs with employer-provided 
health insurance (Mishel et al. 2009)—yet recent college 
graduates are clearly faring better than those who have 
attained only a high school degree. 
 
Wage inequality:  
It is about much more than college
Though this paper does not attempt to break down the 
rise of wage inequality into its various components or 
to analyze the various causes of rising wage inequality, 
we  would  like  to  offer  a  few  findings  that  suggest  that 
the  movement  of  the  college  wage  premium—the  gap 
between college and high school wages—is not central 
to the growth of wage inequality over time.

What is going on at the top
One of the remarkable aspects of the growth of wage and 
income  inequality  over  the  last  three  decades  is  the 
immense  growth  at  the  very  top  of  these  distributions 
relative  to  every  other  group.  This  trend  has  not  been 
explored  frequently  with  the  wage  distribution  because 
the main sources of data do not allow one to separate out 
the top 1%. However, research using Social Security wage 
data that we have been able to update does permit an 
assessment of wage growth at the very top. Consider the 
two illustrations in Figure G. The first shows that annual 
wages for the top 0.1% grew 324% from 1979 to 2006, 
20 times faster than the 16% wage growth of the bottom 
90%  of  wage  earners.  The  top  1%,  which  includes  the 
top 0.1%, had 144% growth in annual wages. The next 
rung down, those in the 95-99th percentile of wages, saw 
wage growth of 52%, at least three times faster than wage 
growth of the bottom 90% but nowhere near the growth 
of the top 1%. 
 
The second part of Figure G demonstrates the dif-
ferences another way, detailing the ratio of the wages 
of the top 0.1% and the top 1% to the wages of the 
bottom 90%.
  What happened at the top is not a trivial matter, as 
the top 1%’s share of all wages almost doubled from 7.3% 
to  13.6%  over  this  period,  nearly  corresponding  to  the 
wage share loss of the bottom 90% (an 8.3 percentage-
point decline in wage share). Thus, what the bottom 90% 
lost essentially accrued to the very top.

The stories usually told about changing production tech-
niques and technological change and patterns of demand 
for  skills  have  little  to  do  with  this  critically  important 
dimension of the growth of wage inequality.

The productivity–pay gap 
During  the  postwar  period  into  the  1970s  productivity 
and pay (compensation or wages per hour) grew in tandem, 
but starting in the late 1970s productivity growth began 
to far outpace the growth of pay. Between 1979 and 2007 
productivity in the nonfarm business sector grew by 73%, 
while the hourly compensation of production, nonsuper-
visory workers (over 80% of all employment) rose by about 
4%, with all of that growth occurring in the boom period 
of the late 1990s. If anything, the divergence between 
pay and productivity has widened in recent years, with the 

divergence stronger in the last recovery than in any prior 
recovery back into the 1970s. 
 
Figure H shows the gap between the growth of pro-
ductivity  and  that  of  the  hourly  compensation  of  the 
median  college-  and  high-school-educated  worker  since 
1995. Each variable is indexed to 1995, so the lines show 
growth relative to their 1995 value. Hourly compensation 
grew in the late 1990s for each type of worker, though 
not  at  the  rate  at  which  productivity  improved.  After 
the momentum of the wage growth in the 1990s boom 
faded in the 2002-03 period, there was no growth in pay, 
though productivity continued to climb (it actually grew 
somewhat faster than in the late 1990s).
This gap between productivity and pay growth is a fun-
damental characteristic of the economy, and a key policy 
challenge is how to reconnect productivity and pay growth.

It is hard to see how we can have rising consumption 
not based on asset bubbles or household debt unless we 
succeed in restoring wage growth as productivity rises.
That is not our focus here, however. The point for our cur-
rent purposes is that the pay of college graduates is as dis-
connected from productivity growth as is the pay of high 
school graduates. Vastly expanding college enrollment and 
completion will do nothing to address this problem.

Education wage gaps are 
 just a part of wage inequality
Many media and other discussions of the need for more 
people to complete college focus on the growth of the 
college  wage  premium,  that  is,  the  degree  to  which 
college graduates earn more than high school graduates. 
It is frequently assumed, as in the discussion by Autor 
and  Acemoglu  above,  that  the  rising  college  premium 
accounts  for  the  growth  of  overall  wage  inequality. 
In fact, that is not the case. Most of the growth of wage 
inequality—the wage gap between a high-wage and low-
wage worker—can be explained by increased wage gaps 
among  workers  with  the  same  education  (e.g.,  the  in-
equality of wages among college graduates) than by wage 
gaps  between  workers  of  different  educations  (e.g.,  the 
college wage premium). That being the case, then even if 
greater college enrollment and completion could eliminate 
the wage gap between college graduates and other workers, 
much of wage inequality (and the greater extent of wage 
inequality  now  versus  the  past)  would  still  remain,  and 
wage inequality would continue to grow.
In more technical language, there are two dimensions 
 
of wage inequality—”between-group” wage differentials, 
such  as  those  relating  to  groups  defined  by  their  edu-
cation and experience, and “within-group” wage inequality 
that  occurs  among  workers  of  similar  education  and 
experience. The growth of within-group inequality can 
account for roughly 60% of the growth of overall wage 
inequality  since  1973  (see  Table  3.21  of  The  State  of 
Working  America; Mishel et al. 2009). The connection 
between growing wage gaps among workers with similar 
education and experience is not easily related to techno-
logical change unless interpreted as a reflection of growing 
economic returns to worker skills (motivation, aptitudes 
for math, etc.) that are not easily measured (that is, the 

regressions used to estimate education differentials can-
not estimate these kinds of differentials). However, there 
are no signs that the growth of within-group wage in-
equality  has  been  fastest  in  those  industries  where  the 
use of technology grew the most. It is also unclear why 
the economic returns for measurable skills (e.g., educa-
tion)  and  unmeasured  skills  (e.g.,  motivation)  should 
not grow in tandem. In fact, between-group and within-
group inequality have not moved together in the various 
sub-periods since 1973.
  The timing of the growth of within-group wage in-
equality  does  not  easily  correspond  to  the  technology 
story.  For instance,  consider what  happened  during the 
1995-2000  period  associated  with  a  technology-led 
productivity boom: within-group wage inequality actually 
declined  among  women  and  was  essentially  flat  among 
men.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  so-called  early  stages  of 
the “new economy,” within-group wage inequality grew 
moderately,  whereas  it  grew  rapidly  in  the  low-produc-
tivity 1980s. Within-group wage inequality did, however, 
start  growing  again  as  productivity  accelerated  further 
after  2000  but  still  lags  far  behind  the  1980s  pace.  All 
in  all,  changes  in  within-group  wage  inequality  do  not 
seem to mirror the periods of rapid productivity growth 
or  technological  change.  Perhaps  more  important,  the 
extent of within-group wage inequality is not affected at 
all by the supply-side education and training policies that 
are usually linked to a claim about a shortage of college 
graduates—so there is no reason to believe that vastly in-
creasing college enrollment and completion will diminish 
within-group wage inequality.
  The growth of inequalities among college graduates 
has  an  important  practical  interpretation  as  well.  As 
Richard Freeman of Harvard University has pointed out, 
the  wider  variance  of  earnings  among  college  graduates 
implies  that  obtaining  a  college  degree  is  becoming  a 
riskier investment.

Wage inequality in the 2000s
It is surprising that the story of the education premium 
driving wage inequality persists in the face of its complete 
failure to explain wage inequality in the 2000s. Most dis-
cussions, like those referred to above, make it seems as if 
the trends of the 1980s were a juggernaut that continued 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 18

unabated throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, the 
demand for college graduates relative to other workers has 
grown the least in this decade compared to other post-
war decades, and the college premium, which has grown 
substantially since the late 1970s, has not grown much at 
all in recent years. Finally, the actual real wage of college 
graduates has not grown in about 10 years. Along these 
lines it is noteworthy that the jobs obtained by young 
college graduates in recent years pay less than the jobs 
obtained  by  those  graduating  five  and  10  years  earlier, 
both in terms of their wages and in the probability that 
employers provide health insurance or pension coverage.
 
Together, these trends suggest that the forthcoming 
supply of college graduates is meeting the growing demands 
of  employers  for  such  workers.  Moreover,  these  trends 
suggest  that  a  rapid  expansion  of  the  supply  of  college 
graduates will cause the wages of college graduates to de-
cline, assuming that the productivity–pay gap continues 
unabated.  We  can  expect  the  wages  of  young  college 

graduates  and  male  college  graduates  (whose  wages  are 
currently in decline) to experience the steepest declines. 
That  may  or  may  not  be  a  desirable  outcome,  but  it  is 
definitely not the outcome that most people would expect 
given the claims that graduating many more people from 
college will prevent a rise of inequality or reduce inequality.

A relatively flat line  
cannot explain a rising line
Table 5 presents two wage ratios, one describing the dif-
ference between high-wage and middle-wage workers (the 
logged wage ratio of the 95th percentile to the median) 
and  the  other  the  difference  between  the  wages  earned 
by  college  graduates  and  high  school  graduates  (called 
the  college–high  school  wage  premium).  The  data  in 
Table 5 show the changes in the last three business cycles 
(1979-89, 1989-2000, and 2000-07) in terms of both the 
total change and the annual change (which allows for a 
better comparison of periods of different length).

In the 1980s the trends in overall wage inequality at 
the top half of the wage distribution—illustrated by the 
95/50 wage ratio—correspond closely to the growth of the 
college wage premium. In the 1990s business cycle both 
wages continued to rise, though at a somewhat slower 
pace. More significant for our discussion, though, is that 
the college premium in the 1990s no longer was rising 
as fast or faster than the 95/50 wage ratio: rather, the 
college premium rose about 70% as fast. This divergence 
became  even  stronger  in  the  2000s,  when  the  college 
wage premium rose hardly at all (up 0.003 log points per 
year for men) and the 95/50 wage ratio continued to grow 
strongly among men (the same 0.01 log point pace as in 
the  1990s)  and  among  women  (though  at  a  somewhat 
slower pace than in the 1990s). It is hard to explain how 
a  trend  that  became  relatively  flat—the  growth  of  the 
college wage premium—is said to be driving fast-growing 
wage inequality. 

The relative demand for  
college graduates slows down
Table 6 presents estimates of changes in the relative wages, 
relative supply, and relative demand for college graduates 
(those with a four-year degree or more and some of those 
with an education beyond high school) for periods covering 
the last 90 years (from the work of Claudia Goldin and 
Lawrence  Katz).  These  measures  show  whether  college 
graduates  are  becoming  better  paid  and  more  plentiful  
relative  to  those  without  a  college  degree.  Using  an 
assumed value for the elasticity of substitution (i.e., how 
easy it is to replace a college worker with one who does 
not  have  a  college  degree  in  the  process  of  producing 
goods and services) one can calculate, as this table does, 
trends in relative demand for college graduates. In effect, 
the  more  the  relative  supply  or  the  relative  wage  of 
college graduates increases, the more the relative demand 
for college graduates must have risen (or else the increased 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 20

relative  supply  would  have  led  to  lower  relative  wages). 
Because these measures include those with an advanced 
degree  beyond  college  along  with  those  with  at  most  a 
bachelor’s degree, they overstate, in my view, the growth 
of the relative demand and wages of those with a bachelor’s 
degree (although one cannot be sure, since some workers 
with  less  than  a  college  degree  are  also  included).  For 
purposes of this discussion we will refer to this group as 
college graduates.
  What does the pattern in Table 6 tell us? First, the 
relative demand for college graduates grew over the entire 
period (except during the special circumstances of World 
War II, when wages grew faster for non-college workers), 
and an expanding relative supply of college graduates 
occurred throughout this period. In this light we can safely 
say  that  employers  have  demonstrated  an  increasingly 
greater need for college graduates over this entire period.
The data in Table 6 are also informative about the last few 
decades. In the 1970s the wages of college graduates de-
clined relative to other workers in response to a rapid growth 
in the supply of college graduates that overwhelmed the 
growing need for them. But their relative wages rapidly 
recovered and grew in the 1980s. It is this growth of the 
college  wage  at  a  time  of  rapid  growth  in  overall  wage 
inequality that has focused attention on education/wage 
gaps and led to technological change as an explanation. 
 
It  is  critical  to  note,  however,  that  the  trends  since 
1990, especially in the 2000s, do not fit an explanation 
of a technologically driven demand for college-educated 
workers driving up their wages and therefore driving up 
wage inequality. Note that the relative demand for college 
graduates grew more slowly in the 1990s than in any pre-
vious period since World War II, and that relative demand 
grew even more slowly in the 2000-05 period than in the 
1990s. That is, the rapid growth of the need for college 
graduates is not a juggernaut launched in the early 1980s 
that continues to this day: rather, the relative demand for 
college graduates has been slowing down in each decade 
since the 1980s and is now growing at a historically slow pace. 
It is this slow pace of the most recent period that might be 
the best clue to the future needs for college graduates.
  This change in trend would suggest that the argument 
that we are in a time of historically rapid change in the 
need for education/skills in the workplace is not accurate, 

at least if one equates a college degree with skills. In fact, 
during the entire period since 1980 the relative demand 
for college graduates grew no faster than during the prior 
30 years. So, given that wage inequality grew faster in 
recent decades than in earlier decades when technologi-
cally driven demands for college graduates were at least as 
rapid, it is difficult to say that a more rapid rise in tech-
nological change drove up wage inequality in recent years. 
That is, there was not an acceleration of a technologically 
driven demand for college graduates that can explain why 
wage inequality rose in the last three decades but did not 
in the prior three decades.
  The  fact  that  skill-biased  technological  change  has 
not been more rapid in recent years, as evidenced by the 
measured growth in relative demand for college graduates, 
is even clearer when one digs a bit deeper into the mea-
sures used in Table 6. The measure of relative demand, 
as explained earlier, is deduced from changes in relative 
supply and the growth in relative wages. It is more accu-
rate to say that this measure of relative demand captures 
all  non-supply  factors  that  influence  relative  wages,  in-
cluding all institutional changes (minimum wage, union-
ization, norms, etc.) and all changes in relative demand 
(arising from technological change but also globalization, 
shifts in consumer demand toward services, and so on). In 
this light, technical change is just one component driving 
the measured “relative demand” for college graduates pre-
sented in Table 6. Given that other factors have been more 
important in the last few decades, including institutional 
ones,  such  as  the  lowering  of  the  minimum  wage  and 
deunionization (which raise the relative wage of college 
graduates by lowering the wages of those without a college 
degree), and globalization, it seems certain that technical 
change was playing a smaller role in the last few decades 
than in the pre-1980 period.
 
Last,  note  that  the  growth  of  the  college  wage 
premium in the 2000-05 period was the slowest of any 
period, other than when the premium actually declined 
in  the  1970s  (due  to  the  rapid  expansion  of  college 
graduates) and during World War II. This measure, how-
ever, includes those with advanced degrees beyond college 
(and some who have less than a four-year college degree), 
so it may actually be overstating the growth in the college 
premium in recent years.

The wage growth of  
college graduates in the 2000s
We have already seen in Figure H that the real hourly com-
pensation  (wages  and  benefits)  of  both  college  graduates 
and high school graduates failed to grow in the recovery of 
the prior business cycle. Figure I shows the trends of the 
median weekly earnings of college graduates (those with just 
a bachelor’s degree) and high school graduates since 2000. 
These data are drawn from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
wage series for those ages 25 and over. As the data show, 
the median college graduate was earning the same weekly 
pay in 2009 as in 2000. This stagnation of wages for college 
graduates preceded the current Great Recession. 
  The wage trends are even more disappointing when 
one examines recent college graduates, a group one might 
imagine includes the best technologically prepared group 

of college graduates. In updating State of Working America 
analyses  we  have  found  that  young  college  graduates 
(defined as those ages 23-29) were earning lower wages 
than those who graduated ahead of them. For instance, 
between  2000  and  2007  the  wages  of  young  college 
graduates fell 2.5% among men and 1.6% among women. 
The wages fell a bit more during the recession years from 
2007 to 2009.
  Health  insurance  coverage  has  fallen  among  young 
college graduates in recent years, from 70.6% covered in 
2000 to 65.7% in 2007. Pension coverage among young 
college graduates fell from 54.6% in 2000 to 46.6% in 
2007. This sharp reduction in both health and pension 
benefits for young college graduates over the last few years 
indicates a substantial job quality problem even for those 
with the highest educational attainment.

 ●   PagE 22

It  is  also  noteworthy  that  weekly  wages  have  fallen 
 
about $40 for the median male full-time college graduate 
between the first half of 2000 and the comparable period 
in 2010. 

Will a large expansion of college graduates 
lead to reduced wages and benefits?
The  most  recent  trends,  those  in  the  prior  business 
cycle  plus  those  in  the  current  downturn,  indicate  that 
the demand for college graduates is growing at a histori-
cally slow rate and that the wages of college graduates have 
been stagnant. The earlier discussion of structural unem-
ployment in the recession showed that unemployment has 
affected college graduates a great deal and that the college 
graduate  share  of  unemployment  and  long-term  unem-
ployment has remained at pre-recession levels. These data 
provide some confirmation that the recession is not intro-
ducing a major shift favorable to college graduates. In this 
environment we have seen that the wages and benefits of 
young college graduates have deteriorated relative to those 
of their older siblings who graduated ahead of them. My 
conjecture would be that these demand conditions can be 
expected to prevail in the future and that any major expan-
sion of the supply of college graduates (beyond the pace of 
expansion in recent years) would necessarily lead to steady 
decline in college wages and benefits, with the wages and 
benefits  of  recent  college  graduates  and  male  college 
graduates suffering the most. This would definitely lead 
to less wage inequality, as the wage gap between college 
and high school graduates would shrink. This, however, is 
hardly anyone’s favored recipe for shared prosperity.
 
It would be useful to work through all the expected 
employment  shifts  to  determine  whether  there  are  any 
trends that might lead to a surge in the need for college 
graduates,  though  none  come  to  mind.  Some  trends 
suggest  a  potential  slowing  of  the  growing  demand  for 
college graduates, such as an expected shrinkage of the 
financial sector and pressure on the federal and state and 
local  governments  to  curtail  employment  as  spending 
grows  more  slowly. We  know  that  there  is  a  surge  in 
college enrollment induced by the recession  that may 
already be providing a major boost to their supply. If so 
we  may  have  more  supply  and  less  demand  for  college 
graduates than recent modeling would show.

The future
Finally, let us look at the pay levels and education and skill 
requirements of the jobs that are projected by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics to be created over the next 10 years. 
These projections do not take account of the trends noted 
just above. Some analysts examine which occupations are 
expected to grow at the fastest (and slowest) rates, while 
others examine which occupations will create the most (or 
least)  absolute  number  of  jobs.  Our  purpose  here  is  to 
assess whether the types of jobs that are expected to be 
created will significantly change the wages that workers 
earn or significantly raise the quality of work or the skill/
education  requirements  needed  to  fill  tomorrow’s  jobs. 
This exercise requires an analysis of how the composition 
of jobs will change, i.e., which occupations will expand or 
contract their share of overall employment.
 
Table 7 presents such an analysis for the 754 occupa-
tions  for  which  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  provides 
projections from 2006 to 2016 (there is a later BLS  pro-
jection than this one, though I doubt it will show different 
results). Through a shift-share analysis (weighting each 
occupation’s characteristic, such as wage level, by its share 
of total employment) we can see what the characteristics 
of jobs are in 2006 and what they will be in 2016 if the 
projections are realized.
  There  are  a  few  drawbacks  to  this  analysis.  One 
is that it does not take into account how the jobs of a 
particular occupation (one of the 754 we analyze) will 
change over the next 10 years. (For example, will em-
ployers’  education  requirements  for  a  loan  officer  or  a 
parking lot attendant grow?) In other words, the changing 
“content” of particular jobs is a dimension of future skill 
requirements not captured by our analysis. Second, we 
have no point of historical comparison (due to lack of 
data availability owing to changing occupational defini-
tions) for judging whether growth expected in the future 
is fast or slow relative to the past. 
  There are some strengths of the analysis, too. We are 
able to look at the education and skill requirements of 
occupations in two ways. One is to look at the educational 
attainment in each occupation now and assume that such 
education levels will prevail in the future. The second is 
to use the education and skill requirements that the BLS 
assigns to each occupation. So, we have one measure that

reflects the workers that employers currently hire into 
each occupation (the “revealed preference” of employers) 
and  another  measure  that  draws  on  BLS’  judgment. 
There  is  still  much  to  learn  from  how  occupational 
composition shifts will affect the job and wage struc-
ture, especially whether the claim that there will be a 
jump  in  the  need  for  college  graduates  is  consistent 
with these projections.
 
Table 7 shows that employment will shift to occupa-
tions with higher median annual wages, but the effect 
will be to raise annual wages by 1.1% over 10 years (or 
about 0.1% per year). This is not a large change compared 
to the real wage growth that normally occurs each year or 

to the composition effects evaluated in earlier years (using 
a different occupation coding system). The analysis also 
shows that the jobs of the future will require greater edu-
cation credentials but not to any great extent. In 2006, 
according to these data, the occupational composition of 
jobs requires that 27.7% of the workforce have a college 
degree or more. This share will rise by one percentage 
point to 28.7% by 2016. The jobs will entail no need 
to  expand  the  share  of  the  workforce  with  only  some 
college,  a  group  roughly  the  same  size  as  the  required 
college-educated  workforce.  The  demand  for  workers 
with a high school degree or less will fall slightly, from 
43.6% to 42.6% over the 2006-16 period.

Table 7 also provides a detailed assessment of the edu-
 
cation or training needed to be employed in an occupa-
tion. The results suggest a shift to the occupations that 
require the most education or training (those requiring a 
bachelor’s degree or more increase their employment share 
by less than a percentage point) and, correspondingly, a 
shift from those occupations that require the least educa-
tion and training (the bottom three categories lose a 1.1 
percentage-point share of employment). Nevertheless, this 
method of gauging occupational skill requirements yields 
a lower estimate of the share of jobs requiring a college 
degree or more, just 21.4% in 2016; the other method, 
based  on  actual  education  in  those  occupations  today, 
suggests a higher 28.7% of college graduates needed. So, 
using assessments of skill requirements in each occupation 
suggests a somewhat smaller growth in skill requirements 
and growth to a lesser level in 2016.
  These projections show that occupational upgrading 
will continue in the future, as the jobs created will be in 
occupations with somewhat higher wages and educational 
and  training  requirements.  This  trend  has  been  evident 
over the last century, and the developments in the future 
do not appear to be extraordinary in any sense. The need 
to greatly expand the size of the college-educated work-
force cannot be demonstrated by looking at occupational 
projections. If future workers will need much more edu-
cation than those currently working, it will only occur 
if  the  education  requirements  in  particular  occupations 
rise substantially.

Conclusion on the looming shortage 
of the college educated
More  education  and  training  is  necessary  to  obtain  the 
long-term growth we desire and to provide equal access to 
job opportunities for the entire population and workforce. 
This was the case 30 years ago and remains the case today. 
Individuals deciding whether to pursue more education 
and  training  would  be  wise  to  enhance  their  human 
capital, as it will place them in a better position as wage 
earners and as citizens.
  That being said, the challenge we face with high and 
persistent  unemployment  exceeding  9%  is  not  better 
education and training for those currently unemployed. 
Rather, we need more jobs. Moreover, the reason we have 

seen a huge increase in wage and income inequality over 
the last 30 years is not a shortfall in the skills and educa-
tion of the workforce. Workers face a “wage deficit” much 
more than a “skills deficit.” 
  Moving forward, our primary challenge is not gener-
ating a greatly expanded supply of college graduates 
because  otherwise  employers  will  not  have  a  sufficient 
number  available  to  them.  Rather,  we  need  to  provide 
access to further education (i.e., college completion) for 
the  many  working  class  and  minority  children  who  are 
now  excluded  from  it  so  they  can  have  a  full  oppor-
tunity to compete for the jobs that require such an edu-
cation.  Greatly  expanding  the  pool  of  college  graduates 
may help to lessen wage and income inequalities, but it 
will do so by forcing young college graduates to take jobs 
with lower pay and benefits than earlier cohorts and by 
pushing downward the average college graduate’s earnings 
(especially  those  of  men).  Those  with  advanced  degrees 
will continue to see their salaries rise, but that group is 
only about a tenth of the workforce and even with rapid 
expansion its share will only rise slowly.  
  The  challenge,  in  my  view,  is  to  provide  a  much 
broader path to prosperity, one that encompasses those 
at  every  education  level.  The  nation’s  productivity  has 
grown  a  great  deal  in  the  last  30  years,  up  80%  from 
1979 to 2009, and such productivity growth or better 
can be expected in the future. Yet with all the income 
generated in the past and expected in the future it is dif-
ficult to explain why more people have not seen rapid 
income growth. It is not the economy that has limited or 
will limit strong income growth, but rather the economic 
policies pursued and the distribution of economic and 
political power that are the limiting factors.

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987:  SUPPLY  AND 

DEMAND  FACTORS* 

LAWRENCE F.  KATZ  AND  KEVIN  M.  MURPHY 

A simple  supply  and demand  framework  is used  to analyze  changes  in the  U.  S. 
wage  structure  from  1963  to  1987.  Rapid  secular  growth  in  the  demand  for 
more-educated  workers,  """"more-skilled""""  workers,  and  females  appears  to  be  the 
driving  force behind  observed  changes  in  the  wage  structure.  Measured  changes  in 
the  allocation  of labor between  industries  and occupations  strongly  favored  college 
graduates  and  females  throughout  the  period.  Movements 
in  the  college  wage 
premium  over this  period appear to be strongly  related  to fluctuations  in the  rate of 
growth  of the  supply  of college  graduates. 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Wage  inequality  among  both  men  and  women 

increased 
substantially  in the United  States  during the  1980s.  Changes  in the 
wage  structure  along  three  primary  dimensions  played  an  impor- 
tant  role  in  rising  inequality.  First,  there  was  an  increase  in  wage 
differentials  by  education  with  a  particularly  sharp  rise  in  the 
relative  earnings  of college graduates.  Second,  the  average wages  of 
older  workers  increased  relative  to  the  wages  of younger  workers 
for those  with  relatively  low  levels  of education.  The  combination 
of these  two  changes  generated  an increase  in the  weekly  wages  of 
young  male  college  graduates  by approximately  30 percent  relative 
to young  males  with  twelve  or fewer  years  of schooling  from  1979 
to  1987.  Third,  earnings  inequality  also  increased  greatly  within 
narrowly  defined  demographic  and skill groups. Although  the  male 
and  female  wage  structures  widened  considerably,  differences  in 
earnings  between  men  and  women  narrowed  throughout 
the 
1980s.  The  average  wage  of  women  increased  by  about  8  percent 
relative  to the  average  wage  of men  from  1979  to  1987. 

Although  the  pattern  of  movements  in  the  U.  S.  wage  struc- 
ture  in the  1980s  is well documented,'  much disagreement  remains 
concerning  the fundamental  causes  of the changes.  Several explana-

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF  ECONOMICS 

tions  have  received  much  attention.  One  class  of  explanations 
postulates  that  changes  in  the  U.  S.  wage  structure  during  the 
1980s  are  driven  primarily  by  shifts  in  the  relative  demand  for 
labor  favoring  more-educated  and  """"more-skilled""""  workers  over 
less-educated  and """"less-skilled""""  workers  and favoring  females  over 
males.  One  variant  emphasizes  technological  changes  (possibly 
associated  with  the  computer  revolution)  that  are  likely  to  have 
raised  the  relative  demand  for more-educated  and flexible  workers 
and reduced the demand  for physical  labor [Davis and Haltiwanger, 
1991;  Krueger,  1991;  Mincer,  1991].  A  second  hypothesizes  that 
shifts  in product demand  largely associated  with  large trade deficits 
in  the  1980s  have  led  to  a  sharp  decline 
in  manufacturing 
employment  and  a  shift  in  employment  toward  sectors  that  are 
education  and female intensive  [Murphy and Welch,  1991]. Alterna- 
tive  explanations  focus  on  changes  in  wage-setting 
institutions 
such  as  the  decline  in  unions  [Freeman,  1991],  changes  in  pay 
norms  [Mitchell,  1989],  and  the  erosion  of  the  real  value  of  the 
minimum  wage  [Blackburn,  Bloom,  and Freeman,  1990]. 

In this  paper we examine  how far one can go toward explaining 
recent  changes  in  relative  wages  in  the  United  States  using  a 
simple  supply  and  demand  framework.  Rather  than  focusing  on 
changes  in relative  wages  during  the  1980s  in isolation,  we analyze 
relative  wage  movements  over the  longer  25-year  time  period from 
1963  to  1987.  By examining  this  longer  time  period, we are able to 
evaluate  the  ability  of  competing  explanations  to  explain  a  wide 
range  of wage  observations  (such  as both  falling  college  wage  pre- 
miums  in the  1970s  and rising  college wage premiums  in the  1980s) 
as well as differences  in timing  in changes  in wage differentials. 

The paper is organized  as follows.  Section  II describes  the  data 
from the  March Current  Population  Surveys  that  we use  through- 
out  the  paper.  Section  III  uses  these  data  to  describe  the  basic 
patterns  of change  in real  and  relative  wages  in the  United  States 
over the  1963  to  1987  period.  Section  IV outlines  the  simple  factor 
demand  model  that  we  use  to  interpret  these  relative  wage  data 
and  evaluates  the  ability  of simple  demand  shift  stories  to  explain 
the  observed  patterns  of  changes  in  relative  factor  prices  and 
supplies.  Section  V  expands  the  basic  model  to  incorporate  both 
within-  and  between-industry  components  of  relative  factor  de- 
mands.  Section  VI uses  the  basic framework  to examine  changes  in 
education  and experience  differentials.  Section  VII summarizes  our 
conclusions. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987

We conclude  that  rapid secular  growth  in the  relative  demand 
for  """"more-skilled""""  workers  is  a  key  component  of  any  consistent 
explanation  for rising  inequality  and changes  in the wage  structure 
over  the  last  25  years.  Although  much  of  this  shift  in  relative 
demand  can  be  accounted  for by  observed  shifts  in  the  industrial 
and  occupational  composition  of  employment  toward  relatively 
skill-intensive  sectors,  the  majority  reflects  shifts  in relative  labor 
demand  occurring  within  detailed  sectors.  These  within-sector 
shifts  are likely  to reflect  skill-biased  technological  changes.  Differ- 
ences  in the time  pattern  of rising  education  differentials  and rising 
within-group  inequality  suggest  that  they  are distinct  phenomena.

II.  THE  DATA 

The  data  we  use  in  this  paper  come  from  a  series  of  25 
consecutive  March  Current  Population  Surveys  (CPSs)  for survey 
years  1964  to  1988.  These  CPS  data  are  from  the  March  Annual 
Demographic  Supplement  and  provide  information  on  earnings 
and  weeks  worked  in  the  calendar  year  preceding  the  March 
survey.  These  surveys  provide  wage  and  employment  information 
on approximately  1.4 million  workers  for the  1963  to  1987  period. 
From  these  CPS  data  we  create  two  samples:  (1)  a  wage  sample 
that  we  use  to  measure  weekly  wages  of  full-time  workers  by 
demographic  group and  (2) a count  sample  that  we use  to measure 
the  amount  of labor supplied  by each of these  demographic  groups. 
The  taxonomy  we  use  divides  the  data  into  320  distinct  labor 
groups,  distinguished  by  sex,  education  (less  than  12,  12,  13-15, 
and  16  or  more  years  of  schooling),  and  40  single-year  potential 
experience  categories  (corresponding  to the  first 40 years  since  the 
estimated  age of labor market  entrance).2 

2.  Potential  experience 

is  calculated  as  min(age  -  years  of  schooling  -  7, 

age  -  17) where  age is the  age at the  survey  date.

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF  ECONOMICS 

The  wage  measure  that  we  use  throughout  the  paper  is  the 
average  weekly  wage  of  full-time  workers  (computed  as  total 
annual  earnings  divided  by  total  weeks  worked)  within  a gender- 
education-experience  cell.3  Our  wage  sample  includes  full-time 
wage  and  salary  workers  who  participated  in the  labor force for at 
least  39  weeks  in  the  calendar  year  prior  to  the  March  survey, 
worked at least  one week,  and did not work part year  due to school, 
retirement,  or  military  service.  Self-employed  workers  and  those 
working  without  pay  were  excluded  from  the  wage  sample.  The 
sample  includes  individuals  for whom  the  Census  imputed  wages 
but  makes  a correction  for the  fact that  the  imputation  procedures 
changed  between  the  1975 and  1976 March CPS surveys.4 Workers 
with  top  coded  earnings  were  imputed  annual  earnings  at  1.45 
times  the  annual  topcode  amount.  This  correction  is based  on our 
estimates  of the  conditional  average  earnings  of  those  with  earn- 
ings  above the  topcode.  In addition,  we excluded  workers  with  real 
weekly  earnings  below  $67  in  1982  dollars  (equal to one half of the 
1982  real minimum  wage  based  on a 40-hour  week).  As best  as we 
can  ascertain  from  experimentation,  our  results  are  not  highly 
sensitive  to these  exclusion  criteria. 

The  count  sample  includes  all individuals  who  worked  at least 
one  week  in  the  preceding  year  (regardless  of  whether  they  were 
wage and salary workers,  self employed,  or otherwise).  We compute 
total  hours  worked  for  each  cell  in  each  year  by  computing  the 
product  of  total  annual  hours  (weeks  worked  times  usual  weekly 
hours)  and the  individual  CPS sample  weight  for each individual  in 

3.  Weeks  worked are available  only  on a bracketed  basis  for survey  years  prior 
to  1976.  To impute  weeks  worked  for the  1964-1975  surveys,  we  divided  the  wage 
sample  for  the  later  survey  years  into  cells  defined  by  the  weeks  worked  brackets 
used  in  the  earlier  surveys  and  sex.  We used  the  means  of weeks  worked  for these 
cells  from the  1976-1988  surveys  as our estimates  of weeks  worked  for individuals 
in the  corresponding  cells in the  earlier  surveys. 

4.  The  Census  began using  a finer classification  of observables  to impute  wages 
for  workers  who  failed  to  report  wages  in  the  1976  survey.  Since  information  on 
which  workers  had  imputed  wages  is  not  available  for  the  years  1963-1966,  one 
cannot  construct  a wage  series  using  only  workers  without  imputed  wages  for our 
entire  sample  period.  To adjust  group  average  wages  for changes  in the  imputation 
procedures,  we multiplied  the  average  wages  in each cell for the years  1963-1975  by 
a  time-invariant,  cell-specific  adjustment 
factors  were 
picked to impose  the  condition  that  the  average  percentage  wage difference  between 
the  wages  of all workers  and  those  of workers  without  wage  imputations  were  the 
same  in  the  1967-1975  and  1975-1987  periods.  Our  qualitative  findings  for  the 
1967-1987  period  are  quite  similar  when  we  use  our  adjusted  series  including 
imputed  wages  and  when  we  use  only  workers  without  wage 
workers  with 
imputations.  See Lillard, Smith,  and Welch  [1986]  for a discussion  of the  changes  in 
techniques  to impute  missing  data implemented  with  the  1976  survey.

the  cell and then  summing  over all the  individuals  in the  cell.5 We 
use  these  total  hours  measures  as  estimates  of  the  total  labor 
supplied  to the  U.  S. market  by individuals  with  given  characteris- 
tics.  The  total  hours  calculations  for each  cell are then  deflated  by 
the  sum  of total  hours  worked  over all cells  so that  hours  for each 
cell  in  each  year  are  expressed  as  a fraction  of total  annual  hours 
that  year. 

The  use  of two  separate  samples,  one  for  measuring  supplies 
and  one  for  measuring  prices,  reflects  the  different  criteria  each 
sample  must  meet.  The primary concern with  the wage sample  is to 
obtain  data  on  a  group  that  maintains  a  reasonably  constant 
composition  through  time  thus  providing  estimates  of  the  prices 
received  by workers  of given  skills.  In this  regard,  our  goal was  to 
maximize  the  comparability  through  time.  This  is why  we tried  to 
focus  on  full-time  workers  with  reasonably  strong  labor  force 
attachment.  For  purposes  of  computing  supply,  the  desire  for 
is  overridden  by  the  requirement  of  measuring  an 
homogeneity 
aggregate  quantity. 

Our wage  data can be summarized  by the  (320  x  25) matrix  W 
which  contains  the  average  weekly  wage  from the  wage  sample  for 
each  of our  320  groups  in  each  year  from  1963  to  1987.  When  we 
describe  wages  for more  aggregated  groups,  we  use  a fixed-weight 
aggregation  scheme  where  the  fixed weights  are given  by the  320- 
element  vector  of  average  employment  shares  over  the  1963  to 
1987  period  which  we  denote  N.  In  addition,  we  use  this  same 
vector  of  fixed-weights  to  construct  wage  indices  for  each  year  as 
N' W. Deflating  wages  in each year by the  value  of this  index for the 
year  generates  a  time  series  of  relative  wages  by  groups  (where 
each  group's  wage  is  indexed  to  the  wages  for  a  fixed  bundle  of 
workers).  The  average  of  these  relative  wages  through 
time 
provides  an  estimate  of the  average  relative  wage  of a given  group 
and  hence  provides  a  natural  basis  for  aggregating  quantities  of 
labor  supplied  across  groups  in  terms  of  efficiency  units.  Accord- 
ingly,  when  we  measure  quantities  of labor  in  efficiency  units,  we 
compute  more  aggregate  supplies  from the  individual  cell  supplies 

5.  Total  hours  worked  for groupj  in year t is given  by 

t  where  i indexes 
individuals,  h  is  annual  hours  worked,  and  X  is  the  CPS  sample  weight.  Usual 
weekly  hours  for  the  previous  year  are  only  available  in  the  CPS  since  1976.  For 
survey  years  1964-1975  we  use  hours  worked  during  the  survey  week  to  measure 
usual  weekly  hours  in  the  previous  year.  For individuals  who  did not  work  during 
the  survey  week,  we  imputed  usual  weekly  hours  using  the  mean  of hours  worked 
last  week  for individuals  of the  same  sex  and  same  full-time/part-time 
status  who 
reported  hours  worked last week  on that  year's  survey.

a.  The  numbers  in  the  table  represent  log  changes  in  mean  weekly  wages  using  data  from  the  March 
Current  Population  Surveys  for  1964-1988.  Mean  weekly  wages  for  full-time  workers  in  each  of  320 
sex-education-experience  cells  were  computed  in  each  year.  Mean  wages  for  broader  groups  in  each  year 
represent  weighted  averages  of these  cell means  using  a fixed set  of weights  (the  average  employment  share  of 
the  cell  for  the  entire  1963-1987  period).  All  earnings  numbers  are  deflated  by the  implicit  price  deflator  for 
personal  consumption  expenditures.

III.  REAL AND  RELATIVE  WAGE  CHANGES,  1963-1987 

Table  I describes  changes  in  the  real  weekly  wages  of the  full 
labor  force  and  of  individual  demographic  groups  for  the  1963- 
1987  period  and  for  three  periods,  1963-1971,  1971-1979,  and 
1979-1987.6  Over  the  entire  period  average  real  weekly  wages 

6.  We  compute  real  wages  by  deflating  nominal  wages  in  each  year  by  the 
implicit  price  deflator  for  personal  consumption  expenditures  from  the  National 
Income  and Product  Accounts. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987

increased  by  16.1 percent.7 This  growth  in real wages  breaks  down 
into  a  19.2  percent  increase  between  1963  and  1971  and  small 
subperiods.  The 
declines  during  the  1971-1979  and  1979-1987 
major  difference  between  these  computations  and  more  standard 
measures  of  average  real  wages  is  that  the  measures  in  Table  I 
refer  to  wages  for  a  fixed  demographic  distribution  (the  average 
employment  distribution  over the  1963  to  1987  period)  and  hence 
do not reflect changes  in the level of wages  arising  from shifts  in the 
education,  gender,  or experience  composition  of the  labor force. 

The  next  two  rows  of the  table  indicate  that  wages  of women 
increased  by 9 percent  relative  to the  wages  of men  over the  entire 
period.  This  reduction  in  the  overall  gender  gap  in  earnings  was 
in  the  1980s.  In  fact,  the  earnings  of  women  in- 
concentrated 
creased  relative  to those  of men  in almost  all experience-education 
cells  during  the  1980s.  Panel  A  of  Figure  I  contrasts  the  time 
pattern  of  changes  in  the  female/male  wage  ratio  for  high  school 
and college  graduates  from  1963  to  1987.8 Although  the  narrowing 
of  the  gender  gap  in  wages  started  earlier  for  college  graduates 
than  for  high  school  graduates,  the  increase  in  the  female/male 
wage  ratio  is  much  more  substantial  in  the  1980s  for high  school 
graduates. 

The  next  four  rows  of  Table  I  show  real  wage  changes  by 
education  level. For the full period, real wage changes  are monoton- 
ically  increasing  in  education  level,  reflecting  a rise  in  education- 
based  wage  differentials.  The  timing  of  the  growth  in  education 
is  very  uneven,  however.  From  1963  to  1971  college 
returns 
graduates  gained  about  8 percent  on  other  groups.  Between  1971 
and  1979  real  wages  fell  the  most  for  college  graduates,  by  10.1 
percent,  and  actually  increased  slightly  for the  two  least-educated 
groups.  In  contrast,  from  1979  to  1987  college  graduates  gained 
14.1  percent  on  high  school  dropouts  and  11.7  percent  on  high 
school  graduates.  Since  these  changes  more  than  make  up  for the 
decline  in  the  relative  wages  of  college  graduates  over  the  1970s, 
the  college  wage premium  was  higher  in the  late  1980s  than  at any 

7.  We refer to  100 times  log changes  as percentage  changes  in this  section. 
8.  The  female/male  wage  ratios  reported  in  the  figure  are  computed  by  first 
level  and  five-year  potential 
sorting  the  data  into  cells  defined  by  education 
experience  intervals.  The  reported  female/male  wage  ratios  are  fixed-weighted 
averages  of the  ratios  of the  average  weekly  wage  of females  to the  average  weekly 
wage  of males  in  each  cell where  the  fixed weight  for each  cell  is  the  cell's  average 
share  of  total  employment  over  the  entire  1963-1987  period.  The  wage  ratios 
reported  in  the  other  panels  of  Figure  I are  analogous  fixed-weighted  averages  of 
wage  ratios  for  cells  defined  by  gender,  education  level,  and  five-year  experience 
interval.

other  time  during  our  sample  and  most  likely  at  any  other  time 
during  the  postwar  period  [Goldin and Margo,  1992]. 

Panels  B  and  C of  Figure  I  further  illustrate  changes  in  the 
earnings  of  college  graduates  relative  to  high  school  graduates. 
Panel  B  documents  movements 
in  the  fixed-weighted  average 
college/high  school  wage ratio for all workers  and for workers  with 
one  to  five years  of experience.  The  figure  highlights  much  larger 
swings  in educational  differentials  for young  workers than  for older 
workers  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  In  fact,  the  college/high  school 
wage ratio for young  workers  fell from  1.61 in  1969  to  1.44 in  1979 
and  then  increased  sharply  to  1.82  in  1987.  Panel  C shows  that 
fluctuations  in  the  college  wage  premium  were  quite  similar  for 
men  and women. 

The  next  two  rows  of  Table  I examine  real  wage  changes  by 
experience  level  for males.  Over the  entire  sample  period the  wage 
gap  between  older  and  younger  workers  expanded  with  peak 
earners,  those  with  26 to 35 years  of experience,  gaining  12 percent 
on  new  entrants,  those  with  1 to  5 years  of experience.  Although 
experience  differentials  for  men  expanded  throughout  the  period, 
they  increased  most  substantially  during the  1980s. 

The  final  rows  of  Table  I  present  real  wage  movements  for 
education  by  experience  cells  for  males.  Two  distinct  patterns 
emerge.  First,  high  school  graduates  and  high  school  dropouts 
show the largest  increases  in experience  differentials  (16.3 and 10.8 
percent,  respectively)  and  for  both  groups  this  increase  is  ac- 
counted  for  entirely  by  the  rise  in  experience  returns  in  the  final 
time  interval.  For  college  graduates  the  time  series  of  experience 
returns  is quite  different.  Experience  differentials  increase  sharply 
in  both  of  the  first  two  time  intervals  so  that  from  1963  to  1979 
experienced  college graduates  gained  16.5 percent  on new entrants. 
However,  during  the  1980s  the  relative  wages  of  young  college 
graduates  increased  sharply.  The  differences  in  the  patterns  of 
changes  in  experience  differentials  for  high  school  and  college 
graduates  are graphed  in Panel  D of Figure  I. 

We  have  so  far  referred  to  changes  in  real  wages  for  groups 
distinguished  by  sex,  education,  and  experience.  However,  given 
that  these  factors  account  for  only  about  one  third  of  the  differ- 
ences  in wages  across workers,  there  is significant  room for relative 
wage changes  within  these  categories  as well. We use the dispersion 
of relative  wages  within  our gender-education-experience  cells  as a 
measure  of the  spread in relative  wages  across  different  skill  levels 
within  the  cells.  Empirically  we  do this  by looking  at the  distribu- 

44 

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 

tion  of residuals  from a regression  of log weekly  wages  on a quartic 
in  experience  fully  interacted  with  sex  and  four  education-level 
dummies,  and  linear  terms  in  education  within  these  categories. 
The  distribution  of  residuals  from  this  regression  essentially 
captures  the  dispersion  of wages  within  the  demographic  groups. 

We summarize  these  results  in panel  A of Figure  II where  we 
plot  the  differences  in  the  log  wage  residuals  of  those  at  the 
ninetieth  and  at  the  tenth  percentiles  of  the  distribution  of  log 
wage  residuals  for men  and women.  Within-group  (residual)  wage 
inequality  has  expanded  enormously  for  both  women  and  men 
from  1963  to  1987.  The  log  wage  gap  between  the  ninetieth  and 
tenth  percentile  worker  within  experience-education  groups  in- 
creased  by  approximately  0.26  for  men  and  0.21  for  women  from 
in  wage  inequality  within 
1963-1987.  This  striking 
groups  means  that  not  only  have  the  less-educated  and  less- 
experienced  workers  lost  out  over  our  sample  period  but  so  too 
have  the  """"least-skilled""""  or  """"least-lucky""""  workers  within  each 
category. 

increase 

An  examination  of  the  time  series  displayed  in  Panel  A  of 
Figure  II  shows  that  residual  inequality  started  to  expand  in  the 
early  1970s  and continued  increasing  rather  smoothly  in the  1980s. 
This  time  pattern  contrasts  sharply  with  the  pattern  for education 
differentials.  We conclude  from these  differences  in timing  that  the 
general  rise  in  within-group  inequality  and  the  rise  in  education 
premiums  over  the  1963-1987  period  are  actually  somewhat 
distinct  economic  phenomena.  The earlier increase  in within-group 
inequality  suggests  a rise  in  the  demand  for  """"skill""""  that  predates 
the  recent  rise in returns  to education. 

We  next  examine  changes  in  overall  wage  inequality  by  sex. 
Panel  B of Figure  II plots  movements  in overall  wage  dispersion  as 
measured  by  the  log  wage  differential  between  workers  at  the 
ninetieth  and  tenth  percentiles  of  the  wage  distribution  for  men 
and for women.  The  90-10  log wage differential  for males  remained 
stable  in  the  1960s,  increased  substantially  from  1.18  in  1970  to 
1.29  in  1979,  and  then  expanded  sharply  by  0.18  log  points  from 
1979  to  1987.  Wage inequality  for females  remained  fairly stable  in 
the  1960s  and  1970s,  and then  increased  sharply  from  1.08 in  1979 
to  1.32  in  1987.  The  log wage  gap between  the  ninetieth  and tenth 
percentile  workers  increased  by  0.26  for  men  and  by  0.25  for 
women  from  1963  to  1987.  The pattern  of changes  in  overall  wage 
inequality  over  our  sample  period  is  quite  similar  if  one  uses 
alternative  summary  measures  such  as  the  variance  of log  wages,

the  interquartile  range,  or  a  gini  coefficient  [Juhn,  Murphy,  and 
Pierce,  1989;  Karoly,  1990;  Levy and  Murnane,  1991].  In fact,  the 
weekly  and  hourly  wage  distributions  for  both  men  and  women 
appear to  have  spread  out  fairly  evenly  across  all percentiles  from 
1963 to  1987. 

We conclude  that  all major relative  wage  differentials  with  the 
exception  of  the  male/female  differential  increased  from  1963  to 
1987.  These  basic  changes  in  the  U.  S.  wage  structure  can  be 
summarized  as follows. 

1. The college wage premium  rose from  1963 to  1971,  fell from 
1971  to  1979,  and  then  rose  sharply  from  1979  to  1987.  The 
changes  in the  college/high  school  wage  ratio were  greatest  for the 
youngest  workers  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  and  greatest  for  prime 
age workers  in the  1960s. 

2.  Experience  differentials  expanded  substantially  from  1963 
to  1987.  The  most  dramatic  increases  in  experience  differentials 
occurred for less-educated  males  from  1979-1987. 

3.  Overall  and  residual  weekly  wage  inequality  for  both  men 
and women  (as measured  by the  90-10  log wage  differential)  were 
stable  during  the  1960s  and  then  increased  by  almost  30  percent 
from the  late  1960s  to  1987.  The increase  in residual  inequality  has 
been  quite  steady  since the  early  1970s,  while  the  growth  in overall 
inequality  accelerated  in the  1980s. 

4.  After  remaining  fairly  stable  in  the  1960s  and  1970s, 
male/female  wage  differentials  narrowed  substantially  from  1979 
to  1987. 

IV.  A  SIMPLE  SUPPLY  AND  DEMAND  FRAMEWORK 

We begin  our examination  of the  between-group  relative  wage 
changes  documented  in the  previous  section  using  a simple  supply 
and  demand  framework  in  which  different  demographic  groups 
(identified  by sex, education,  and experience)  are treated  as distinct 
labor inputs.  We think  of the  relative  wages  of demographic  groups 
as being  generated  by the  interaction  of the  relative  supplies  of the 
groups  and  an  aggregate  production  with  its  associated  factor 
demand  schedules.  To the  extent  that  these  different  demographic 
in  production,  we  can  view 
groups  are  imperfect  substitutes 
changes  in  relative  wages  as  being  generated  by  shifts  in  relative 
supplies  and shifts  in the  factor demand  schedules.  The framework 
in  that  we  do  not  specify  the 
is  distinctly  partial  equilibrium 
determinants  of  relative  factor  supplies.  We  only  require  that 
observed  prices  and quantities  must  be """"on the  demand  curve.""""

A. The Basic  Framework 

X,=D(WZ), 

Our basic  framework  involves  an  aggregate  production  func- 
tion  consisting  of  K  types  of  labor  inputs.  We  assume  that  the 
associated  factor demands  can be written  as 
(1) 
where 
X,  =  K  x  1 vector  of labor inputs  employed  in the  market  in year  t 
W,  =  K  x  1 vector  of market  prices  for these  inputs  in year  t 
Zt  =  m  x  1 vector  of demand  shift  variables  in year  t. 
The  demand  shifters  Zt  reflect  the  effects  of  technology,  product 
demand,  and other  nonlabor  inputs  on demands  for labor inputs. 

Under  the  assumption  that  the  aggregate  production  function 
is  concave,  the  (K x  K)  matrix  of  cross-price  effects  on  factor 
demands,  DW, is negative  semidefinite.  Equation  (1) can be written 
in terms  of differentials  as 
(2) 
The negative  semidefiniteness  of DW implies  that 
(3) 
Changes  in  factor  supplies  (net  of  demand  shifts)  and  changes  in 
wages  must  negatively  covary. 

dWt'(dXt -  DzdZt) =  dWtDwdWt <  0. 

dXt =  DWdWt +  DZdZt. 

(e.g.,  Freeman 

[1979]  and  Welch  [1979]) 

One hypothesis  that  has  attracted  much  attention  in previous 
related  research 
is 
whether  shifts  in  relative  supplies  are  the  driving  force  behind 
observed  changes  in relative  wages.  A test  of an extreme  version  of 
this  hypothesis  is to examine  whether  the  data are consistent  with 
stable  factor  demand.  In this  case,  wage  changes  are generated  by 
relative  supply  changes  arising  from  changing  demographics  and 
school  completion  rates.  In  the  case  of  two  inputs  the  basic 
implication  of  stable  relative  factor  demand  is  that  an  increase  in 
the  relative  supply  of  a  group  must  lead  to  a  reduction  in  the 
relative  wage  of  that  group.  More  generally,  if  factor  demand  is 
stable  (Z  fixed), equation  t3) implies  that  dW'dXt <  O. We use  our 
estimates  of  the  time  series,  (Xt, Wt), t  =  1963,  .  . 
,  1987,  and  a 
discrete  version  of this  equation  to test  for stable  demand.  Specifi- 
cally, we test  for fixed factor demand  between  the  year  t and year  T 
by evaluating  whether 

(4) 

(Wt- W)  (Xt  XT) ?0. 

This inequality  provides a natural  way in which to evaluate  the 

48 

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF ECONOMICS 

pure  supply  shifts  story.  Periods  of time  in which  the  inequality  in 
(4)  is  satisfied  (i.e.,  the  inner  product  of  changes  in  wages  and 
changes  in  factor  supplies  is  nonpositive)  have  the  potential  to  be 
explained  solely  by  supply  shifts.  When  this  inequality 
is  not 
satisfied,  no  story  relying  entirely  on  supply  shifts  is  consistent 
with  the  data.  In this  case,  we can evaluate  alternative  hypotheses 
concerning  relative  demand  shifts  (alternative  proxies  for Z,) using 
the  discrete  version  of (3) given by 
(5) 
where  we  compute  the  inner  product  of the  change  in  wages  from 
year T to year t with  the  changes  in net  supplies  (equal to the  actual 
change  in  supply  less  the  change  in demand  for X that  would  have 
happened  at fixed factor prices). 

(Wt -  WT)'[(Xt -  XT) -  (D(WT, Z)  -  D(WT, ZT))] <  0, 

In  our  implementation  of  this  framework,  we  are  concerned 
with  explaining  relative  wage  changes  as  a  function  of  relative 
supply and relative  factor demand  shifts.  We abstract  from changes 
in absolute  wages  arising  from factor-neutral  technological  change 
and  from  neutral  demand  shifts  associated  with  changes  in  the 
scale  of  the  economy.  To  do  so,  we  use  a  relative  wage  measure 
(actual  wages  W, deflated  by the  wage  index  N'Wt,  where  N  is  the 
(K x  1) vector  of average  employment  shares  over the  entire  sam- 
ple  for  the  K  labor  inputs)  and  a  relative  supply  measure  (actual 
supplies  Xt deflated  by  the  total  supply  of  labor  in  the  economy 
measured  in  efficiency  units  f'Xt,  where  fl  is the  (K x  1) vector  of 
average relative  wages  over the  entire  sample)  when  we empirically 
evaluate  (4) and (5).9 

9.  The  use  of  these  relative  wage  and  quantity  measures  can  be  formally 
justified  as follows.  We first  assume  that  the  aggregate  production  function  can be 
written  as yt =  +  F(Xt)  where  4t indexes  the  state  of technology  of the  economy  and 
FO is concave.  The concavity  of FO implies  that 

[F. (X)  -  F (X)]'(Xt -  X)  -  0, 

where  FX is the  K  x  1 vector  of derivatives  of F with  respect  to the  K inputs.  Under 
the  assumption  that  marginal  products  are set  equal  to factor  prices,  we have  W  = 
XtF.(Xt ) for all t so that  the  inequality  can be rewritten  as 
-WT k)](Xt  X)  -  0. 

[ ( WI4) 

- 

If we  further  assume  that  there  are constant  returns  to  scale  in production  so 
that  FO  is  a linear  homogeneous  function,  then  F.(ktXt)  =  F/(Xt)  for any  scalar  kt. 
Thus,  Wt =  4~tF.(ktXt ) and  W, =  b),F/kXX)  for  any  scalars  kt and k,. This  implies 
that  the  inequality, 

[(Wt/4))  -  (W-/4)1](ktXt 

kXT)  <  0 

also holds for any scalars kt and kT. This final inequality  is the  form of (4) that  we use 
in  our empirical  tests.  We approximate  the  level  of productivity  at  time  t, 4t, using 
the  value  of our wage  index N'Wt,  and we multiply  the  factor  quantities  Xt in year  t 
by one over the  total  supply in efficiency units.

B. Relative  Supply  Changes 

Table II summarizes  changes  in relative  factor supplies  (where 
each  group's  supply  is  measured  relative  to  the  total  supply  in 
efficiency  units)  over  the  1963-1987  period  and  the  subperiods 
1963-1971,  1971-1979,  and  1979-1987 
for  the  same  aggregates 
used  to  analyze  changes  in  wages  in  Table  I.  The  table  illustrates 
that  there  has  been  substantial 
long-run  growth  in  the  relative 
supply  of  more-educated  workers,  younger  workers,  and  women. 
The  increase  in  the  average  educational  attainment  of  the  labor 
force is particularly  striking.  The  share  of aggregate  hours  worked 
contributed  by  college  graduates 
increased  from  13.0  to  26.3

a. The  numbers  in the  table  represent  log changes  in each  group's  share  of total  labor  supply  measured  in 
efficiency units  (annual  hours  times  the  average relative  wage of the group for the  1963-1987  period) using  data 
from the  March Current  Population  Surveys  for  1964-1988.  Supply  measures  include  all workers  in the  count 
sample  described  in the  text. 

50 

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF ECONOMICS 

percent  from  1963-1987,  while  the  share  for high  school  dropouts 
fell  from  39.2  to  12.6  percent  over  the  same  period.  Since  the 
relative  supplies  and wages  of more-educated  workers  and women 
increased  over the  sample,  relative  demand  changes  favoring  these 
groups  are necessary  to explain  the  observed  data. 

On the  other  hand,  the  table does illustrate  the possibility  that 
differences  in  the  rate  of  growth  in  the  relative  supply  of  college 
graduates  may  help  explain  the  time  pattern  of  changes  in  the 
college wage  premium.  The largest  increase  in the  supply  of college 
graduates  comes  during  the  1971-1979  period in which  the  college 
wage  premium  declined,  and  the  smallest  growth  of supply  comes 
during  the  1979-1987  period  in  which  the  college  wage  premium 
expanded  sharply.  A  smooth  secular  increase 
in  the  relative 
demand  for college  graduates  combined  with  the  observed  fluctua- 
tions  in  the  rate  of  growth  of  relative  supply  could  potentially 
explain  the  movements  in the  college  wage  premium  from  1963  to 
1987. 

An  analogous  story  emphasizing  smooth  trend  growth  in  the 
relative  demand  for  women  and  relative  supply  growth  variation 
seems  less  likely  to  provide  a  complete  story  for  changes  in  the 
gender  gap in earnings.  The rate of growth  of the  share  of the  labor 
force  accounted  for by  women  is  more  rapid  in  the  1970s  than  in 
the  1960s  or 1980s.  The deceleration  in the rate of growth  of female 
labor  supply  in  the  1980s  combined  with  a  secular  growth  in  the 
relative  demand  for  industries  and  occupations  in  which  women 
have  been  concentrated  may  help  explain  the  greater  earnings 
gains  made by women  in the  1980s  than  in the  1970s.  On the  other 
hand,  the  acceleration  in  the  growth  rate  of  relative  supply  from 
the  1960s  to  the  1970s  bodes  poorly  for  an  explanation  based  on 
supply  growth  fluctuations  since  the  relative  earnings  of  women 
declined  in the  1960s. 

Changes  in  the  age  structure  of  the  labor  force  may  be  an 
important  part  of  an  explanation  for  secular  increases 
in  the 
relative  earnings  of  older  workers.  The  share  of  labor  supply 
(measured  in efficiency units)  accounted  for by workers  with  one to 
ten years  of experience  increased  rapidly from  18.9 percent  in  1963 
to a peak of 30.8  percent  in 1980 and then  decreased  to 27.4  percent 
in  1987.  The  secular  increase  in  the  share  of  young  workers 
consisted  of  dramatic  increases 
in  the  relative  supply  of  new 
entrants  from  the  mid-1960s  to  the  late  1970s  as  the  baby  boom 
cohorts  entered  the  labor  force  combined  with  a  sharp  decline  in 
the  share of new entrants  in the  1980s  with  the passage  of the baby 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

51 

boom  cohorts  into  mid-career.  This  pattern  of changes  in  relative 
supplies  can help explain  increases  in experience  differentials  in the 
1970s,  but  it  has  some  difficulties  with  the  sharp  increases  in 
experience  differentials  for less-educated  males  in the  1980s. 

C. Can Relative  Supply  Changes  Explain  Relative  Wage Changes? 
To more formally examine  how relative  supply changes  line up 
with  the  relative  wage  changes,  we  implement  the  framework 
outlined  above.  For the  analysis  in this  section  we  divide  our  data 
into  64  distinct  labor  groups,  distinguished  by  sex,  4  education 
categories  (8-11,  12,  13-15,  and  16+  years  of  schooling),  and  8 
experience  categories  (1-5,  6-10,  11-15,  16-20,  21-25,  26-30, 
31-35,  and 36-40  years).  We begin  with  equation  (4) and compute 
the  inner  products  of  changes  in  relative  wages  with  changes  in 
relative  factor  supplies  between 
time  periods.  To  reduce  the 
number  of computations  and minimize  the impact  of measurement 
error,  we  aggregate  our  25  years  into  5  five-year  intervals  and 
compute  average  relative  wages  (relative  to  our  wage  index)  and 
average  relative  supplies  for  each  of  our  64  groups  within  these 
subperiods.  We then  compute  the  inner  products  of the  changes  in 
these  measures  of wages  and  supplies  between  each  pair  of these 
five intervals. 

The  results  of  these  calculations  are  given  in  the  top  part  of 
Table  III.  The  data  appear  to  be  reasonably  consistent  with  the 
stable  demand  hypothesis  for the  1965-1980  period. Five of the  six

comparisons  for  this  period  are  negative,  and  the  positive  one  is 
quite  small  and  might  be  difficult  to  distinguish  from  sampling 
error.  In contrast,  all comparisons  involving  the  interval  centered 
in  1985  are  positive  and  thereby  reject  a  stable  factor  demand 
structure.  Our findings  are quite  similar when  we limit  the analysis 
to men. 

Figure  III illustrates  these  patterns  by plotting  changes  in log 
relative  supplies  against  changes  in  log  relative  wages  for  the  64 
labor groups  for the  period as a whole  and for the three  subperiods. 
The  lines  drawn  in  the  figures  represent  predicted  values  from 
weighted  least  squares  regressions  of the  changes  in  log wages  on 
the  changes  in log factor supplies  for each interval  with  the weights 
being  the  employment  shares  of  each  group  in  the  initial  period. 
The four graphs  shown  in the  figure reinforce  the  findings  from the 
inner  products:  for  the  1963-1987  period  as  a  whole  and  most 
strongly  for  the  1980s,  the  groups  with  the  largest  increases  in 
relative  supplies  tended  to  have  the  largest  increases  in  relative 
looking  across  groups,  differential  supply 
wages.  Thus,  when 
growth  alone  seems  like  an  unlikely  candidate  to  explain  the 
observed  changes  in relative  wages  for the  entire  period. In fact, we 
find a negative  relationship  between  growth  in factor  supplies  and 
in relative  wages  only during the  1971-1979  period. These  findings 
indicate  that  demand  growth  was  an  important  component  of the 
change  in  factor  prices  over the  period  as a whole  and particularly 
during the  1980s.  Delineating  the  time  pattern  and nature  of these 
relative  demand  shifts  is our next  goal. 

We first  examine  whether  the  observed  wage  changes  can  be 
made  consistent  with  the  observed  pattern  of  relative  quantity 
changes  simply  by  allowing  for  smooth  trend  changes  in  relative 
demands.  Such  trend  demand  shifts  might  reflect  a steady  pace on 
nonneutral  technological  changes  or steady  changes  in  the  indus- 
trial  composition  of  employment.  To  do this,  we  regress  the  time 
series  of relative  wages  and of quantities  for each  of our 64 groups 
on  a  constant  and  a  linear  time  trend.  We  then  average  the 
residuals  over  five-year  centered  intervals  for  each  group  and 
compute  the  inner  products  in changes  in detrended  relative  prices 
and relative  quantities.  The  results  of this  procedure  are shown  in 
the  bottom  half of Table III. Comparing  these  numbers  with  those 
obtained  without  correcting  for  trend  changes,  we  see  that  many 
more  of  the  comparisons  now  show  negative  inner  products.  We 
infer  from  this  that  trend  demand  growth  alone  can  make  almost 
all  of  the  observed  price  and  quantity  changes  consistent  with

otherwise  stable  demand,  although  the  remaining  positive  inner 
product for the  1980s  in detrended  changes  suggests  some accelera- 
tion in the rate of growth  of demand  for women  and more-educated 
workers  in the  1980s  appears  necessary. 

V.  MEASURING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE DEMAND FOR LABOR 
It is  clear that  substantial  shifts  in  relative  labor demand  are 
necessary  to  explain  observed  changes  in the  wage  structure  since 
the  early  1960s  as  reflecting  changes  in  relative  competitive  wage 
levels.  Changes  in  the  structure  of  product  demand,  increased 
international  competition,  and  skill-biased  technological  change 
have  attracted  much  attention  as  possible  reasons  for  shifts  in 
labor  demand  against  less-educated  males.  We  find  it  useful  to 
think  of relative  labor demand  shifts  as  coming  from  two  types  of 
changes:  those  that  occur within  industries  (i.e.,  shifts  that  change 
the  relative  factor  intensities  within  industries  at  fixed  relative 
wages)  and  those  that  occur  between  industries  (i.e.,  shifts  that 
change  the  allocation  of total  labor  demand  between  industries  at 
fixed  relative  wages).  Important  sources  of within-industry  shifts 
include  factor  nonneutral  technological  change,  changes  in  prices 
of  nonlabor  inputs  (e.g.,  computer  services),  and  """"outsourcing"""" 
(shifts  of portions  of industry  production  out  of the  United  States). 
shifts  in  demand  may  be  driven  by  shifts  in 
Between-industry 
product  demand  across  industries,  sectoral  differences  in  factor- 
neutral  total  factor  productivity  growth,  and  shifts  in net  interna- 
tional  trade  which  change  the  domestic  share  of  output  at  fixed 
relative  wages. 

The  effect  of between-industry  shifts  in  labor  demand  on  the 
relative  demands  for  different  demographic  groups  depends  on 
group differences  in industrial  employment  distributions.  Table IV 
presents  the  distributions  of  employment  among  twelve  broad 
industries  and  three  major  occupational  categories  of  six  gender- 
education  groups.10 The  distributions  in  the  table  are the  average 
distributions  for  each  group  over  the  1967  to  1987  period.11 The 
substantial  differences  in  employment  distributions  indicate  that 

10.  We  focus  on  gender-education  groups  because  differences  in  industrial 
distributions  by  sex  and  education  are  much  more  significant  than  differences  by 
experience  level. 

11.  Because  of  incompatibilities  between  the  industry  and  occupation  codes 
available  in the  1964-1967  CPS surveys  and those  in the  later  surveys,  we limit  our 
analysis  of shifts  in labor demand  arising  from shifts  across industry  and occupation 
cells to the  1967-1987  period.

equipment,  automobile,  other  transport  equipment  (excluding  aircraft),  tobacco,  paper,  printing,  rubber,  and 
miscellaneous  manufacturing  industries.  High  tech  manufacturing  includes  the  aircraft,  instruments,  chemi- 
cals, and petroleum  industries. 

shifts  in  labor  demand  across  industries  and  occupations  may 
greatly  affect the  relative  wages  of these  groups. 

Table  V  illustrates  that  large  changes  occurred  in  the  indus- 
trial  and  occupational  distribution  of  total  employment  over  the 
1967-1987  period. The shift  over the entire  period in the industrial 
employment  distribution  out  of  """"low tech""""  and  """"basic""""  manufac- 
turing  and into professional  and business  services  is suggestive  of a 
trend  demand  shift  in favor of college  graduates  and of women  and 
against  less-educated  males.  The  substantial  decline  in importance 
of production  worker jobs points  toward  similar  demand  shifts.

industry  shifts  in  labor demand  and relative  supply  changes,  then 
the  shares  of  industrial  employment  of  groups  whose  relative 
wages  have  increased  should  tend  to  fall  inside  every  industry. 
Thus,  the  hypothesis  of  stable  within-industry  demand  implies 
that  the  shares  of  women  and  college  graduates  should  have 
declined  in all industries.  Since  the  share  of aggregate  employment 
of  women  and  college  graduates  increased  over  this  period,  this 
scenario  requires  a substantial  shift  in employment  into  industries 
that  intensively  employ  women  and  more-educated  workers.  In 
fact,  an  examination  of  our  CPS  data  indicates  that  the  shares  of 
employment  (measured  either  in  total  hours  or  efficiency  units) 
accounted  for  by  women  and  by  college  graduates  increased  in

almost  every two-digit  industry  both  from  1963 to  1987  and during 
the  1980s.12  This  finding  indicates  that  within-industry  demand 
shifts  favoring  these  groups  must  have  occurred.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  finding  that  within-industry  shifts  must  have  occurred 
does  not  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  between-industry  shifts 
suggested  by Table V are an important  factor in explaining  relative 
wage  changes.  We  next  more  formally  develop  and  implement  a 
procedure  for  assessing  the  magnitude  of  between-  and  within- 
industry  shifts  in relative  labor demands. 

A. Conceptual  Framework 

One  widely  used  measure  of  the  effect  of  between-sector 
demand  shifts  on  relative  labor  demands  is  the  fixed-coefficient 
index  (e.g.,  Freeman  [1975,  1980]). 
""""manpower  requirements"""" 
This  index  measures  the  percentage  change  in  the  demand  for  a 
demographic  group  as the  weighted  average  of percentage  employ- 
ment  growth  by  industry  where  the  weights  are  the  industrial 
employment  distribution  for  the  demographic  group  in  a  base 
period.'3  In  this  section  we  clarify  the  interpretation  of  these 
demand  shift  measures.  These  simple  demand  shift  indices  provide 
appropriate  demand  shift  measures  for implementing  equation  (3) 
to  determine  whether  within-sector  relative  demand  shifts  are 
necessary  to  explain  observed  shifts  in  relative  wages.  Although 
they  provide biased  measures  of """"true""""  between-sector  relative  de- 
mand  shifts  if relative  wages  are not  stable,  the  nature  of the  bias 
can be determined.  These  demand  shift  indices  tend  to understate 
the  relative  demand  shift  favoring  groups  with  increases  in relative 
prices. 

We begin  our formal  analysis  by considering  an  economy  that 
consists  of J  sectors  (which  can  be  thought  of  as  industries  or as 
industry-occupation  cells)  and K labor inputs.  We denote  output  in 
sector  J  by  Yj and  assume  that  production  takes  place  under 
constant  returns  to  scale  in  all  sectors.  We can  write  the  (K  x  1) 
vector  of factor demands  in sectorj,  Xj, as 

(6) 

Xj =  C  (MW)Yj, 

12.  Davis  and  Haltiwanger  [1991]  and  Gottschalk  and  Joyce  [1991]  similarly 
employment  shares  of  groups 

report  for  the  1980s  that  the  within-industry 
increased  with  increases  in relative  wages. 

13.  This  proxy for the  percentage  change  in  demand  for demographic  group k 
XAJk(AEj/Ej  ), wherej  indexes  industry,  E  is total  employment  of 
can be written  as 
all demographic  groups  in  industryj,  XJk =  EJk/(JE  Jk) in  a Iase  year,  and  EJk is the 
employment  of group k in industryj.

where  Ci&(W) is  the  (K  x  1) vector  of  unit  factor  demand  curves 
(i.e., the  partial derivatives  of the  unit  cost function  in sectorj  with 
respect  to  each  group's  own  wage).  Equation  (6) can be written  in 
terms  of differentials  as 

(7) 

dXj =  Ci (W)dYj +  YjCj  (W)dW, 

under the assumption  that  within-sector  demand is stable.  Premul- 
tiplying  by  W and  using  the  result  that  unit  factor  demands  are 
homogeneous  of degree  zero in factor prices,  we derive 

(8a) 

or 

(8b) 

W'dXj =  W'X_(dYjJY1)

so  that  we  can  measure  the  percentage  change  in  outputs  by  the 
value  weighted  percentage  change  in inputs. 

This  result  is  particularly  useful,  since  aggregating  (7) across 

sectors  yields

where  dX  is  the  (K x  1) vector  of employment  changes  and  Cww is 
the  (K x  K)  matrix  that  corresponds  to  the  production-weighted 
average  of the  Hessians  (second  partial derivatives)  of the  unit  cost 
functions  for the  J  industries  and  is  negative  semidefinite.  Equa- 
tion  (9) implies  that

Equation  (10)  is  of  the  form  given  in  equation  (3).  Thus,  an 
appropriate  between-sector  demand  shift  measure  to  evaluate 
whether  the  data are consistent  with  stable  demand  within-sectors 
is the  (K x  1) vector; 

(11) 

AD=  >X  W'dXj 

which  is simply the  vector  of weighted  sums  of sector  employments 
for each factor with  the  weights  given by the  percentage  changes  in 
the  value  of  inputs  in  each  sector.  This  demand  shift  index  is 
exactly  the  standard  fixed-coefficients  index  with  sectoral  employ- 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987

ment  changes  measured  in  efficiency  units  rather  than  in  raw 
hours.  The intuitive  interpretation  of the  index is that  those  inputs 
employed  heavily  in expanding  sectors  will have increased  demand, 
while  those  inputs  employed  mostly  in contracting  sectors  will have 
falling  demand. 

It  is  important  to  note  at  this  point  that  all  quantities 

in 
equation  (11)  are  the  equilibrium  changes  in  factor  employments 
and  are  thereby  directly  measurable.  No  presumption  has  been 
made  as  to  the  source  of the  changes  in  employments  other  than 
the  fact  that  the  sector-specific  unit  cost  functions  are being  held 
fixed.'4 Although  the  demand  index  given  in  equation  (11)  can  be 
directly  inserted  into  equation  (10)  to  test  for  the  stability  of 
demand  within  sectors,  this  demand  index  does  not  provide  an 
unbiased  measure  of """"true"""" between-industry  demand  shifts  when 
relative  wages  are changing. 

The  reason  for this  bias  is  that  changes  in  relative  wages  can 
affect  the  distribution  of  sectoral  outputs  so  that  AD  will  not 
measure  the  effects  of  changes  in  the  allocation  of  labor  demand 
across  sectors  at fixed relative  wages.  The  output  shares  of sectors 
that  intensively  employ  groups  with  relative  wage  increases  are 
likely to fall relative  to what  they  would have been at stable  relative 
wages.  Thus,  AD  is  likely  to  be  a  downward  biased  measure  of 
demand  shifts  in favor of groups  with  relative  wage  increases. 

More  formally,  we  can  write  the  (J  x  1) vector  of  changes  in 

relative  outputs,  dYj, as 

dY  =  dY*  +  YpdP =  dY*  +  YPCWdW, 

(12) 
where  dY*  is  the  (J  x  1) vector  of  """"true""""  product  demand  shifts 
computed  at  fixed  factor  prices,  P  is  the  (J  x  1)  vector  of  sector 
output  prices,  Yp is the  (J  x  J)  matrix  of derivatives  with  respect  to 
the  price  vector  of  the  sectoral  demand  functions,  and  C.  is  the 
(J  x  K)  matrix  of derivatives  of the  unit  cost function  with  respect 
to  own  wages.  The  second  equality  arises  from  the  assumption  of 
constant  returns  to scale which  implies  that  dP  =  C.(W)  dW. Using 
equations  (6),  (8a),  (11),  and  (12),  we  can write  our  demand  index 
as 

(13) 

AD  =  E  C&(W)dYj =  (CW)'dY= (C,)IdY*  +  (C,)'YpCw dW. 

Equation  (13) gives  our demand  shift  measure  in terms  of the  true 

14.  Katz  and  Murphy  [1990]  show  that  this  demand  measure  is  appropriate 

even  in the  presence  of within-sector,  factor-neutral  technological  change.

factor  demand  shift  (C.)'dY*  and  a  bias  term  (C.)'YpC~dW.  If 
(as  will  be  the  case  in  the 
(C,,)'YpCw is  negative  semidefinite 
absence  of income  effects),  this bias term will be inversely  related to 
wage changes  on average  (i.e., the  inner  product  of dW and the bias 
term will be nonpositive).  In the two-factor  case the between-sector 
demand  index  given  in  equation  (11)  will  understate  the  demand 
increase  for  those  groups  with  rising  relative  wages.  More  gener- 
ally, our demand  shift  index will tend  to understate  the  magnitude 
of the true  relative  demand  shifts  favoring  groups with  increases  in 
relative  wages. 

B. Measured  Demand  Shifts,  1967-1987 

To  implement  this  approach  to  measuring  demand  shifts,  we 
divide  the  economy  into  50  two-digit  industries  and  3  occupation 
categories  and  take  the  resulting  150  industry-occupation  cells  as 
our  sectors.  The  advantage  of  adding  occupations  to  the  industry 
taxonomies  used in most  previous  work is that  doing so allows us to 
look at some  dimensions  of within-industry  shifts  in labor demand, 
as well  as between-industry  shifts.  In this  framework  we can think 
of occupations  as  producing  intermediate  goods  within  industries. 
Empirically  we  construct  our  demand  shift  measure  to  corre- 
spond  to  the  index  AD  defined  in  equation  (11).  We  specify  our 
index  of  the  between-sector  change  in  demand  for  group  k  mea- 
sured  relative  to  base  year  employment  of  group  k  in  efficiency 
units,  Ek, as 

(14) 

AXd  ADk 

(EJk)(EJ) 

Aj 

= 

wherej  indexes  sector, Ej is total  labor input  in sectorj  measured  in 
(Ejk/EJ) is  group  k's  share  of  total 
efficiency  units,  and  ?k 
employment  in  efficiency  units  in  sector j  in  the  base  year.  This 
measure  expresses  the  percentage  change  in  demand  for  each 
group  as  a weighted  average  of the  percentage  changes  in  sectoral 
employments  (measured  in  efficiency  units)  in  which  the  weights 
are  group-specific  employment  distributions.  We  turn  equation 
(14)  into  an  index  of  relative  demand  shifts  by  normalizing  all 
employment  measures  so that  total  employment  in efficiency units 
in each year  sums  to one. We choose  the  average  of the  1967-1987 
sample  period  to  be  our  base  period.15  Thus,  we  use  the  average 

15.  Our  basic  qualitative  findings  concerning  measured  demand  shifts  are 

insensitive  to choice of base year. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987

share of total  employment  in sectorj  of group k over the  1967-198  7 
period  as  our  measure  of  Ujk  and  the  average  share  of  group  k  in 
total  employment  over the  1967-1987  period as our measure  of Ek. 
We  define  our  overall  (industry-occupation)  demand  shift 
index  for group  k,  zXX', as  the  index  given  in  (14)  when  j  indexes 
our  150  industry-occupation  cells.  We  also  decompose  this  index 
into  between-  and  within-industry 
components.  The  between- 
industry  demand  shift  index  for group k, AX', is given by the  index 
in  (14)  when  j  refers  to  50  industries.  We  define  our  within- 
industry  demand  shift  index  for k,  AXw, as the  difference  between 
the  overall  demand  shift  index  and  the  between-industry  demand 
shift  index  (i.e.,  AX  -  AX'  -  AXX).  These  within-industry  de- 
mand shifts  reflect shifts  in employment  among  occupations  within 
industries. 

Table VI presents  our relative  demand  shift  estimates  for eight 
demographic  groups  for the  entire  1967-1987  period and for three 
subperiods.  The  overall  measure  of  demand  shifts  for  the  entire 
period  is monotonically  increasing  in  education  level  for both  men 
and  women.  The  overall  measure  also  shifted  in  favor  of  women 
relative  to  men  within  every  education  group  from  1967  to  1987. 
Since  education  differentials  expanded  and  gender  differentials 
narrowed  over  the  1967-1987  period,  the  actual  between-sector 
demand  shifts  toward  more-educated  workers  and  women  that 
would  have  occurred  at  fixed-factor  prices  are  likely  to  have  been 
even  greater  than  the  increases  indicated  in  Table VI.  The  overall 
measure  indicates  that  between-sector  shifts  in  employment 
in- 
creased  the  demand  for male  college  graduates  by over  30  percent 
relative  to  males  with  twelve  or fewer  years  of schooling.  Demand 
shifts  in  favor  of women  are  much  greater  for high  school  gradu- 
ates  and those  with  some  college  than  for high  school  dropouts  and 
college  graduates.  These  differences  reflect  the  concentration  of 
males  but  not  females  with  12 to  15 years  of  schooling  in  produc- 
tion  occupations  and manufacturing  industries. 

Although  the  measured  demand  shifts  toward  more-educated 
workers  and  toward  women  have  been  substantial, 
they  are 
significantly  smaller  than  the  observed  relative  supply  changes 
in  Table  II.  Thus,  changes  in  relative  wages  and 
documented 
changes  in  relative  supplies  net  of  changes  in  the  between-sector 
demand  shift  index  positively  covary  over  the  1967-1987  and  the 
1979-1987  period.  Demand  shifts  within  our  industry-occupation 
cells  are  required  to  explain  the  observed  extent  of  positive 
covariation  in changes  in relative  wages  and relative  supplies.

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

63 

Table VI also  suggests  that  the  pace of overall  demand  growth 
for  college  graduates  appears  to  have  been  relatively  steady  over 
the  1967-1987  period.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  some  differ- 
ences  in  the  time  pattern  of  shifts  in  the  demand  for  female  and 
male  college  graduates.  The  magnitude  of  relative  demand  shifts 
favoring  college  males  appears  to  have  increased  in  the  1980s, 
while  demand  shifts  favoring  female  college  graduates  are smaller 
in  the  1980s  than  in  the  earlier  periods.  These  differences  reflect 
the  rapid  growth  of  the  professional  and  business  services  in  the 
1980s  and the  decline  in relative  employment  in education  and the 
public sector  in this  same period. Furthermore,  the  overall demand 
in  the  between-  and 
shift  index  masks  important  differences 
within-industry  measures  of  demand  shifts.  Between-industry 
shifts  for college graduates  appear to have decelerated  in the  1980s, 
while  within-industry  demand  shifts  (largely  reflecting  an acceler- 
ating  rate  of  decline  in  the  share  of  production  jobs  within 
industries)  have accelerated  throughout  the  period. 

C. Demand  Shifts  Arising  from  Changes  in International  Trade 

We  next  examine  the  importance  of  changes  in  net  interna- 
tional  trade  in  manufactured  goods  as  a  source  of  relative  labor 
demand  shifts.16  Many have  argued that  increased  import  competi- 
tion  particularly  with  the  large U.  S. trade deficits  of the  1980s  has 
played an important  role in shifting  employment  out of manufactur- 
ing  sectors  and  shifting  relative  demand  against  less-educated 
workers. 

To  estimate  the  labor  supply  equivalents  of  trade,  we  trans- 
form  trade  flows  into  equivalent  bodies  on  the  basis  of  the 
utilization  of  labor  inputs  in  the  domestic  manufacturing  indus- 
tries  that  constitute  the  bulk  of the  traded goods  sector.  We do this 
by  estimating  the  direct  labor  supply  embodied  in  trade,  ignoring 
indirect  input-output  effects.  Thus,  the  implicit  labor  supply  in 
trade is the  labor input  required to produce traded  output  domesti- 
cally. Formally,  we let Ii, be net  imports  in industry  i in year t, Yi, be 
domestic  output  of industry  i in year t, and Ei, be the  share  of total 
efficiency  units  in the  U.  S. economy  in year  t employed  in  sector  i 
(IiEi,  =  1). The implicit  supply  of labor embodied  in net  imports  in 
industry  i in year t measured  as a fraction  of total  U.  S. labor input 

16.  See  Borjas,  Freeman,  and  Katz  [1992]  and  Murphy  and  Welch  [1991]  for 
more detailed  treatments  of the  effects  of international  trade flows on relative  labor 
demands.

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF  ECONOMICS 

is given  by (Ei,1Yi,)*Ii,. The  implicit  supply  of labor of demographic 
group  k  contained  in  net  trade  in  year  t  as  a  fraction  of  total 
domestic  labor supply  of k is given by 

(15) 

L= 

z  eEt 

where  ek  is  the  average  proportion  of  employment  (measured  in 
efficiency  units)  in  industry  i made  up  of workers  in  group  k over 
the  1967-1987  period. 

We measure  the  effect  of trade  on  relative  demand  for  demo- 

graphic group k in year t as 

(16) 

Tt  =  -  (E) z 

[eTE t (%)] +  E  Eit 

where  Ek  is  the  average  share  of  total  employment  in  efficiency 
units  of group k for the  1967-1987  period.  The  first term  is simply 
the  implicit  supply  of  the  labor  of  group  k  contained  in  trade 
normalized  by base year  employment  of k with  the  sign  reversed  to 
convert  this  supply  shift  measure  into  a  demand  shift  measure. 
The  second  term  adjusts  the  demand  shift  measure  so  that  trade 
affects  only relative  demands  for labor. 17 

In  equation  (16)  we  assume  that  trade-induced  changes  in  an 
industry's  output  alter the  employment  of production  and nonpro- 
duction  workers  in  that  industry  in  the  same  manner  as  would 
domestic-induced  changes  in  output.  Alternatively,  however,  it  is 
plausible  that  exports  and  imports  may  affect  quite  different 
portions  of  an  industry  and  may  have  differential  impacts  on  the 
employment  of production  and nonproduction  workers.  In particu- 
lar,  while  exports  and  production  for  domestic  consumption  may 
create  employment  for both  kinds  of workers  in a similar  manner, 
imports  may  displace  production  workers  to  a  far  greater  extent 
than  they  displace  nonproduction  workers.  In fact,  many  activities 
of nonproduction  workers  (e.g.,  marketing,  sales,  accounting)  may 
be relatively  complementary  with  production  workers  overseas.  To 
take  into  account  this  issue,  we provide two estimates  of the  effects 
of trade  on  employment.  Under  the  first  method  which  we  denote 
""""equal  allocation,""""  we  directly  employ  equation  (16)  and treat  net 
imports  in  a manner  analogous  to  domestic  production  for domes- 

17.  This  demand  shift  index  has  the  property  that  EkTk  E k  =  0.  Murphy  and 

Welch  [1991]  provide a formal justification  for this  type  of demand  shift  index. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

65 

tic consumption.  Under  the  second  method  which  we denote  """"pro- 
duction  worker  allocation,""""  we  modify  the  first  term  in  equation 
(16) so that  exports  are allocated  to all workers  in the  same  manner 
as domestic  production  for domestic  consumption,  but  imports  are 
allocated  to production  workers  only.'8 

We use  data  on  imports,  exports,  and  output  from  the  NBER 
Immigration,  Trade,  and  Labor Market  Data  Files  to  compute  the 
trade ratios used in the construction  of our indices  of demand  shifts 
arising  from  trade.'9 These  data  cover  four-digit  SIC manufactur- 
ing industries  for each year from  1967 to  1985.  We aggregate  these 
data into  21 two-digit  manufacturing  industries. 

Table  VII  presents  the  changes 

in  relative  labor  demand 
predicted by changes  in international  trade in manufactures  for the 
1967-1973,  1973-1979,  and  1979-1985  periods.  The  table  indi- 
cates  that  the  effects  on relative  labor demands  of trade  were  quite 
moderate  until  substantial  trade  deficits  developed  in  the  1980s. 
The  adverse  effects  of trade  on  relative  labor  demand  are  concen- 
trated  on  high  school  dropouts.  Female  dropouts  who  have  tradi- 
tionally been employed intensively  as production  workers in import- 
competing  industries  such  as  apparel  and  textiles  are  the  group 
most  affected  by  trade.  In  fact,  demand  changes  from  trade  are 
larger  for  female  high  school  dropouts  in  the  1980s  than  are 
domestic  sources  of between-sector  demand  shifts.  The  table  also 
indicates  that  the  effects  of  trade  on  relative  labor  demand  are 
substantially  larger  when  imports  are  assumed  to  disproportion- 
ately  affect  production  workers.  Although  trade-induced  changes 
in  relative  demand  move  in  the  correct  direction  to  help  explain 
rising  education  differentials  in  the  1980s,  they  are  quite  small 
relative  to  the  increases  in  the  relative  supplies  of  more-educated 
workers  over the  same  period. 

18.  We replace the  first term  on the  right-hand  side of the  equation  (16) with 

l1 

(M[ 

Xt)] 

'Ej 

t) 

where X measures  exports, M measures  imports,  andpk  is group k's average  share  of 
production  worker employment  in industry  i over the 
1-X9a7 period. We classify 
as production  workers  those  workers  in  the  manufacturing  sector  in  the  following 
broad  occupational  categories:  craft  workers,  handlers  and  laborers,  operatives, 
transport  operatives,  and service  workers. 

19.  Abowd  [1991]  provides  a  detailed  discussion  of  this  data  set  and  the 
construction  of  trade  data  on  a four-digit  SIC  industry  basis.  The  data  on  output 
and employment  in each  industry  given  by the  NBER  data set  are from the  Annual 
Survey  of Manufactures.

VI.  UNDERSTANDING  CHANGES  IN  EDUCATION  AND  EXPERIENCE 

DIFFERENTIALS 

A. Education  Differentials 

The college/high  school wage premium  increased  from  1963 to 
1971,  fell  from  1971  through  1979,  and  then  rose  sharply  after 
1979.  There  are  two  primary  types  of  explanations 
for  these 
movements  in  the  college/high  school  wage  differential.  The  first 
in  relative  earnings  as  representing 
interprets 
changes  in  the  relative  market  price  of  skills  possessed  by  college 
and high  school graduates. 

these  changes 

The  second  type  of  explanation  focuses  on  changes  in  the 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

67 

composition  of  college  and  high  school  graduates  that  affect  the 
relative  skill  levels  of  the  two  groups.  This  type  of  explanation 
interprets  the  decline  in the  college  wage  premium  in the  1970s  as 
reflecting  a decline  in the  relative  quality  of college  graduates  and 
the  rise  in education  returns  in the  1980s  as reflecting  a decline  in 
the  relative  quality  of  high  school  graduates.  Because  within- 
cohort  comparisons  are likely  to hold the  relative  quality  of college 
and  high  school  graduates  relatively  constant,  this  hypothesis 
suggests  one  should  not  find  important  within-cohort  changes  in 
the  college  wage  premium.  Since  movements  in  the  college/high 
school wage differential  are quite  similar  within  cohorts  and within 
experience  levels  over  our  sample  period  [Blackburn,  Bloom,  and 
it  is 
Freeman,  1990;  Katz  and  Murphy,  1990],  we  conclude 
appropriate to view differences  in the movement  in the  college wage 
premium  in  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s  as  largely  reflecting 
in  the  relative  price  of  college  skills  rather  than  as 
changes 
in  the  relative  quality  of  college 
primarily  reflecting  changes 
graduates.  Thus,  we  turn  to  evaluating  supply  and  demand  expla- 
nations  for changes  in the  relative  price of college  skills. 

We  take  the  overall  college/high  school  wage  ratio  for  males 
and  females  combined  as  the  relative  price  to  be  explained.20 We 
amalgamate  our  320  groups  into  two  labor  aggregates:  college 
equivalent  workers  and high  school  equivalent  workers.  We use  the 
relative  quantity  of  college  and  high  school  equivalents  as  our 
relative  supply variable in assessing  explanations  for movements  in 
the  college/high  school  wage ratio. 

We create  our measures  of college  and high  school  equivalents 
as  follows.  We  construct  aggregate  labor  inputs  (using  a  fixed- 
weight  total  supply  measure  with  weights  proportional  to  average 
wages  over  the  1963-1987  period)  for  each  of  our  four  education 
groups  (8-11,  12,  13-15,  and  16+  years  of  schooling).  We  treat 
high  school  graduates  (those  with  twelve  years  of  schooling)  as 
pure  high  school  equivalents,  and  we  treat  college  graduates  as 
pure  college  equivalents.  We  allocate  other  categories  of  workers 
(those  with  less  than  twelve  years  of schooling  and those  with  some 
college)  to  our  two  aggregate  groups  on  the  basis  of  regressions 
determining  the  extent  to which  their  wages  move with  the  wage of 

20.  In  this  section  we  measure  the  college/high 

school  wage  ratio  as  the 
fixed-weight  average  of the  ratio  of the  average  weekly  wage  of college  graduates  to 
the average weekly  wage of high school  graduates  for sixteen  cells defined by sex and 
five-year  experience  brackets.  The  fixed  weight  for  each  cell  is  the  cell's  average 
share of total  employment  over the  1963-1987  period. This  series  is plotted  in Panel 
B of Figure  I as the  college/high  school  wage ratio  for all experience  levels. 

68 

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 

high  school  graduates  and  college  graduates,  respectively.  For 
those  with  less  than  a  high  school  degree  and  those  with  some 
college,  we  regress  the  average  wage  series  for  each  of  these  two 
groups  on the  wage  series  for high  school  graduates  and for college 
graduates  over the  1963-1987  period.2  (The implicit  assumption  is 
that  each  group  is  a linear  combination  of college  and  high  school 
graduates).  The  regression  results  suggest  that  one  person  with 
some  college  is  equivalent  to  a  total  of  0.69  of  a  high  school 
graduate  and  0.29  of  a  college  graduate,  while  a  high  school 
dropout is equivalent  to 0.93  of a high  school graduate  and  -0.05  of 
a  college  graduate.  We  use  these  coefficients  to  allocate  the 
corresponding  quantities  of  high  school  dropouts  and  those  with 
some  college  to  the  high  school  and  college  quantities  to  form  the 
supplies  of high  school  and college  equivalents. 

We  consider  the  simplest  CES  technology  with  two  factors 
(college  and high  school  equivalents)  so that  relative  wages  in year 
t,  w,(t)/w,(t),  and  relative  supplies  in  year  t, x,(t)/x2(t),  satisfy  the 
relationship 

(17) 

log  (wi(t)= 

(A) [D(t) -g  (xl(t))] 

where  u is  the  elasticity  of  substitution  between  college  and  high 
school  equivalents  and  D(t)  is  the  time  series  of  relative  demand 
shifts  measured  in  log  quantity  units.  Given  that  there  are  other 
inputs  in  the  production  function,  this  is  a  conditional  factor 
demand  framework  which  requires  that  demand  shifts  be  defined 
to  include  the  effects  of changes  in  the  prices  (or equivalently  the 
supplies)  of these  other  inputs. 

The  elasticity  of  substitution 

is  an  unknown  parameter,  and 
the  time  series  of D(t)  is unobservable.  Under  the  assumption  that 
the  economy  operates  on the  demand  curve given  by equation  (17), 
a  given  value  of  the  elasticity  of  substitution  between  factors 
(a  =  (,,) implies  a time  series  of demand  shifts: 
(18) 
The  greater  the  elasticity  of substitution  between  the  two  factors, 
the  smaller  the  impact  of  shifts  in  relative  supplies  on  relative 
wages  and  the  greater  must  be  the  fluctuations  in D(t)  to  explain 
any  given  time  series  of  relative  prices  for  a  given  time  series  of 
observed  relative  quantities. 

D(t) =  Uo log  (w1(t)/w2(t)) +  log  (x,(t)/x,(t)). 

21.  The regressions  do not contain  intercept  terms. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

69 

We take  two  approaches  to  developing  stories  consistent  with 
the  observed  time  series  on  prices  and  quantities.  The  first  is  to 
estimate  u  by  running  (17)  by  ordinary  least  squares  under  the 
that  D(t)  is  approximated  by  a  simple  linear  time 
assumption 
trend.  We are somewhat  skeptical  of estimates  of u recovered  from 
25  nonindependent  time  series  observations.  Our second  approach 
is to use  equation  (18) to impute  D (t) conditional  on a choice for the 
value  of  u.  For  any  given  value  of  u,  we  can  evaluate  the  implied 
explanation  by examining  whether  the  implied  time  series  for D (t) 
matches  well  with  the  measures  of between-  and  within-industry 
demand  shifts  developed  in the  previous  section. 

The  basic  movements  in  our  relative  price  and  relative  quan- 
tity  measures  over  our  sample  period  are  summarized  in  the  top 
part  of Table VIII.  The  relative  supply  of college  equivalents  grew 
tremendously  over  this  period,  and  the  college  wage  premium 
increased  substantially.  A regression  of the  log  of the  ratio  of the 
supply  of college  to  high  school  equivalents  on a linear  time  trend 
for the  1963-1987  period yields  a coefficient  of 0.045  (t = 41.5),  and 
the log relative  price series  is almost  orthogonal  to trend.  Hence  the 
relative  demand  for  college  equivalents  has  grown  by  about  4.5 
percent  per year on average  over the  sample  period. 

The  key  question  to  be  addressed  is  the  degree  to  which  the 
time  series  of  the  college  wage  premium  has  been  driven  by 
fluctuations  in  the  growth  of  supply  versus  the  extent  to  which  it 
has  been  driven  by fluctuations  in  demand-side  factors.  Figure  IV 
graphs  the  detrended  wage  and  price  series  (in  Panels  A  and  B). 
Since  the  price series  has  little  trend,  the  series  in  Panel  A is quite 
similar  to the  overall  returns  to  college  series.  The  quantity  series 
plotted  in  Panel  B  and  summarized  in  Table  VIII  reveals  some 
important  features,  however:  supply  grew  more  slowly  than  aver- 
age  from  1963-1971, 
faster  than  average  from  1971  until  about 
1979,  and  then  more  slowly  than  average  again  in  the  1980s.  It 
in  supply 
appears  that  an  explanation  emphasizing  fluctuations 
growth  has  the  potential  to  explain  observed  fluctuations  in  the 
college wage premium. 

Thus,  the  model  in equation  (17)  in which  D(t)  is proxied  by a 
linear  time  trend  may fit the  data reasonably  well.  OLS estimation 
of this  equation  for the  1963-1987  period yields

substitution  between  college  and  high  school  labor  of  about  1.41. 
The  actual  time  series  of college  returns  and the  fitted  values  from 
this  regression  are  shown  together  in  Panel  C of  Figure  IV.  The 
figure  shows  that  this  model  does  a tolerable  job  of explaining  the 
movements  in the  college wage premium  except for the  period from 
the  late  1970s  to the  early  1980s. 

Panel  D in Figure  IV shows  the  implied  demand  series  derived 
from  (18)  for  elasticities  of  substitution  of  0.5,  1.41,  and  4  with 
demand  normalized  to  equal  0 in  1963.  The  figure  illustrates  that 
there  is  a  one-dimensional  family  of  implied  demand  shifts  (in- 
dexed  by  a)  that  are  consistent  with  the  observed  price  and 
quantity  time  series.  The  implied  demand  shifts  range  from 
relatively  steady  demand  growth  when  a  is  small  (0.5  to  1)  to 
demand  growth  which  slows  significantly  in the  1970s  and acceler- 
ates  greatly  during the  1980s  when  a is moderate  to high. 

To  see  how  alternative  demand  shift  scenarios  compare  with 
the  observed  pattern  of between-sector  demand  shifts  calculated  in 
the  previous  sections,  we  aggregate  the  demand  shift  measures  by 
education-gender  groups  presented  in Table VI into  demand  shifts 
for  college  equivalents  relative  to  high  school  equivalents.  Table 
VIII  compares  these  shifts  with  movements  in  the  relative  supply 
of  college  equivalents.  Our  demand  shift  index  implies  that  the 
relative  demand  for  college  graduates  increased  by  10.2  percent 
from  1971-1979  and by 9.9 percent  from  1979-1987.  There  is little 
direct  indication  of  an  acceleration  in  the  growth  of  the  relative 
demand  for more highly  educated  workers  from these  demand  shift 
indices.  On the  other  hand,  our analysis  of the  nature  of the  bias in 
these  indices  indicates  that  the  demand  shift  index understates  the 
""""true"""" between-sector  growth  for college graduates  relative  to high 
school  graduates  in  the  1980s  and  overstates  the  shifts  in  the 
1970s.  Furthermore,  the  overall  demand  shift  measure  masks  a 
combination  of  a  deceleration  in  measured  between-industry  de- 
in  measured  within-industry 
mand  shifts  and  an  acceleration 
demand  shifts  from the  1970s  to the  1980s.  The measured  demand 
shifts  explain  about  one  third  of the  implied  trend  demand  shifts 
consistent  with  the  observed  time  series  of prices and quantities. 

B. Experience  Differentials 

We  next  examine  explanations  for  movements  in  experience 
differentials  for  males  over  the  1963-1987  period.  We  focus  on 
males,  since  our  measure  of  potential  experience  is  likely  to  be  a 
worse  indicator  of actual  experience  for wtnuen  than  for imen  We 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

73 

take the  ratio of the wage of males  with  26 to 35 years  of experience 
(old workers  or peak earners)  to the wage  of males  with  1 to 5 years 
of experience  (young  workers  or new  entrants)  as the  relative  price 
to be explained. 

The  path  of  the  log  old/young  wage  differential  for  all  males 
over  our  sample  period  is  presented  in  Panel  A  of  Figure  V.  The 
overall  old/young  wage  differential  for  males  was  reasonably 
constant  from  the  mid-1960s  to  1970,  increased  sharply  in  the 
early  1970s,  remained  stable  in  the  late  1970s,  and  increased 
greatly  in the  1980s.  The log old/young  wage  differential  increased 
by approximately  0.12  over  the  entire  period.  The  time  pattern  of 
the  changes  in experience  differentials  for all men  is dominated  by 
changes  for those  with  less  than  sixteen  years  of schooling.  Panel  D 
of Figure  I showed  that  experience  differentials  increased  markedly 
from  1979  to  1987  for  high  school  graduates  and  actually  fell  for 
college  graduates  over the  same  period.  These  sharp  differences  in 
a  period  of  rising  education  differentials  are  suggestive  of  the 
""""active  labor  market""""  hypothesis  of  Freeman  [1975]  in  which 
in  the  labor  market  show  up  most  sharply  for  new 
changes 
entrants  because  more  senior  workers  are  insulated  by  labor 
market  institutions,  such  as  seniority  layoff systems,  and valuable 
firm-specific  capital.  In particular,  the  collapse  of new  employment 
in  the  manufacturing 
opportunities 
sector  in  the  1980s  is  likely  to  have  had  its  most  severe  impact  on 
young  less-educated  males. 

for  less-educated  workers 

We first examine  the  ability  of changes  in the  relative  supply of 
more- to less-experienced  workers  to explain  changes  in experience 
differentials.  Table  II indicates  that  the  relative  supply  of workers 
with  one to ten years  of experience  increased  greatly  over the  entire 
1963-1987  period  but  actually  declined  in  the  1980s  as  the  baby 
boom  cohort  workers  became  more  experienced  and the  baby bust 
cohort  entered  the  labor market.  This  suggests  that  the  growth  in 
relative  supply  of  young  workers  can  help  explain  the  secular 
growth  in experience  differentials  but  will  have  trouble  explaining 
changes  in  the  1980s.  On the  other  hand,  the  fraction  of workers 
with  eleven  to twenty  years  of experience  grew rapidly in the  1980s, 
and it is a priori unclear  how an expansion  of the  supply  of workers 
in this  group  affects  the  earnings  of new  entrants  relative  to  peak 
earners. 

We  attempt  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  how  multidimensional 
changes  in  the  age  structure  of  the  labor  force  affect  the  relative 
earnings  of old to young  workers by using  a relative  supply variable

that  aggregates  all  experience  groups  into  two  groups  (old  and 
young  equivalents).  The  construction  of  this  variable  is  exactly 
analogous  to  the  construction  of  college  and  high  school  equiva- 
lents  above.  We treat  workers  with  26  to  35 years  of experience  as 
pure  old  equivalents  and  those  with  1 to  5 years  of  experience  as 
pure  young  equivalents.  We  allocate  workers  in  the  five  other 
five-year  experience  brackets  (6-10,  11-15,  16-20,  21-25,  36-40 
years)  to  our  two  aggregate  groups  on  the  basis  of  regressions 
(without  intercepts)  of  their  wages  on  the  wages  of  those  with 
26-35  and  1-5  years  of experience.22 

We display the  time  path  of the  log relative  supply  of young  to 
old equivalents  in panel  B of Figure  V. The basic movements  in the 
relative  supply  of young  to  old  equivalents  look  quite  similar  to  a 
smoothed  version  of  the  changes  in  the  old/young  wage  ratio 
illustrated  in  panel  A  of  the  figure.  In  particular,  the  long-term 
is  quite  consistent  with  the 
growth  in  experience  differentials 
long-term  increase  in  the  share  of young  equivalent  workers.  Yet 
the  timing  of the  changes  in  experience  differentials  (particularly 
movements  in  the  mid-1970s  and  the  1980s)  does  not  match  up 
well  with  the  smoothly  declining  rate  of  growth  of  the  relative 
supply of young  equivalents. 

These  points  are brought  out by a comparison  of movements  in 
actual  experience  differentials  and  the  predicted  values  from  a 
regression  over  the  1963-1987  of the  log old/young  wage  ratio  on 
the  log relative  supply of old to young  equivalents.23 The actual  and 
predicted  values  from  this  regression  are  contrasted  in  panel  C of 
Figure  V. The  regression  does  a good job  of explaining  the  secular 
growth  in  experience  differentials  but  fails  to  explain  the  sharp 
increase  in the  1980s.  The active  labor market  hypothesis  suggests 
that  a  weak  market  for  less-educated  workers  may  help  explain 
widening  experience  differentials  for  less-educated  workers  since 
young  less-educated  workers  will  bear  the  brunt  of adjustment  to 
changing  market  conditions.  The  addition  of the  log  of the  overall 
college/high  school  wage  ratio  to  our  specification  (essentially  as a

VII.  CONCLUSIONS 

A  simple  supply  and  demand  framework  helps  illuminate 
many  aspects  of changes  in  the  U.  S. wage  structure.  The  relative 
wages  and  quantities  of  more-educated  workers  and  women  in- 
creased  substantially  from  1963  to  1987.  Within-group  and overall 
wage inequality  also increased  sharply over this  period. Substantial 
secular  growth  in the  demand  for more-educated  workers,  females 
and """"more-skilled""""  workers  within  groups is necessary  to interpret 
the  observed  changes  in  relative  wages  as  changes  in  competitive 
skill  prices.  Measured  changes  in  the  allocation  of  labor  demand 
between  sectors  (150  industry-occupation  cells)  can  account  for  a 
large minority  of the  secular  demand  shifts  in favor of groups  with 
rising  relative  wages.  Demand  shifts  arising  from  changes 
in 
international  change  in manufacturing  only start to be of quantita- 
tive  significance  with  the  appearance  of large  trade  deficits  in  the 
1980s.  The  majority  of  the  required  demand  shifts  in  favor  of 
more-educated  workers  and  females  reflect  difficult  to  measure 
changes  in  within-sector  relative  labor  demand.  Recent  work  by 
Krueger  [1991]  suggests  that  the  spread  of  computers 
in  the 
workplace  may be  an  important  component  of these  within-sector 
changes  in the  composition  of labor demand. 

The pattern  of changes  in the  wage  structure  differed substan- 
tially  in  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s.  The  college  wage  premium 
increased  moderately  in  the  1960s,  declined  in  the  1970s,  and 
expanded  dramatically  in  the  1980s.  Differences  across  the  three 
decades  in the  rate  of the  growth  of the  supply  of college  graduates 
as a fraction  of the  labor force appear to  play an important  role  in 
explaining  these  large  differences  in  the  behavior  of  the  relative 
earnings  of college  graduates.  Fluctuations  in the  rate  of growth  of 
relative  supply  do  not  greatly  help  illuminate  differences  across 

24.  The  regression  of the  log  relative  earnings  of  old to  young  males  (RE)  on 
the  log relative  supply  of old to young  equivalents  (RSUP)  and the  log of the  overall 
college/high  school wage premium  (CHSPREM)  yields  a coefficient  (standard  error) 
of  -0.348 
(0.028)  on  RSUP  and  of  0.292  (0.106)  on  CHSPREM  and  has  an  R2 of 
0.87.

decades  in  changes  in  the  male/female  wage  differential.  Within- 
group  earnings  inequality  was  stable  in  the  1960s  and  has  in- 
creased  steadily  since  the  early  1970s.  The  differences  in  the  time 
pattern  of  rising  education  differentials  and  rising  within-group 
inequality  suggest  that  they  are at least  partially  distinct  economic 
phenomena. 

Much  recent  work  indicates  that  economic  pressures  toward 
increased  inequality  and  skill  differentials  arising  from  between- 
in  labor  demand  and  skill-biased  technological 
industry  shifts 
change  appear  important  in  most  OECD  economies  in  the  1980s 
(e.g.,  Gottschalk  and  Joyce  [1991];  Katz  and  Loveman  [1990]). 
Although  wage  structures  appear  to  have  started  to  expand  in 
almost  all  OECD  countries  by  the  middle  of  the  1980s,  the 
magnitude  of the  changes  varies  substantially.  The extent  to which 
this  divergence  in  wage  structure  changes  across  countries 
is 
explained  by differences  in the  supply  and demand  factors  empha- 
sized  in  this  paper  as  opposed  to  differences 
in  wage-setting 
institutions  is an important  topic for future  research.

In a recent speech, President Bush acknowledged a problem that economists and policy makers have long
been concerned about: the growth of economic inequality. The president went on to offer this explanation
for the growth in unequal economic outcomes:

“The reason is clear: We have an economy that increasingly rewards education and skills because of that
education.”1

In fact, there is no evidence that the recent growth in income inequality is due to increased rewards to
education. To the contrary, for the first few years of this business cycle, the college premium-the wage
advantage to college educated workers-actually fell slightly, implying other factors are responsible for
inequality’s recent resurgence.

First, let us be very clear: the earnings advantage to persons with higher levels of education is one of the
most persistent findings in economics. And for many years, that advantage was growing: not only did
college educated workers earn more than persons with only a high school degree, but the difference grew
quickly, particularly over the 1980s.

Second, there are clear and obvious advantages-economic and social-to achieving higher levels of
education, both for individuals and for society.

That said, policy makers too often, like the president, reduce the growth of inequality to this sole factor,
even when the evidence points elsewhere. Here, we collect a number of those facts.

The chart  shows the trend in the college wage premium just noted, adjusted for the set of relevant factors
that labor economists typically control for in this type of analysis, including age, race, gender, region
where workers live, and marital status. The college premium increased from 25% in the late 1970s, to
45% in the late 1990s and has since flattened, even trailing off a bit in the early 2000s, before ticking up
slightly in 2005. Thus, the argument that employers’ skill demands were bidding up the wage premium to
those with more education was arguably true (other factors were involved here too, noted below) over the
1980s and 1990s, but not in the 2000s.

Next, though the inequality debate references relative wages-the earnings of one education group
compared to another-note that the actual inflation adjusted earnings of college graduates rose very little
over this business cycle. Between 2000 and 2006, hourly wages of workers with a college degree (B.A.
only) grew by only 1.4%. This wage estimate omits fringe benefits, and as these costs rose over the

period, a full compensation measure would show more growth, but Gould  (2006) shows that the share of
college-educated workers with employer-provided health care fell by about 3.6 percentage points, 2000-
05. (Gould finds larger coverage losses among less-educated workers.)

In a similar vein, Allegretto  (2007) shows that the employment rates of young college graduates (the
share of young college graduates that are employed) are still recovering from the cyclical decline in their
employment rates that occurred between 2000 and 2003. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for employment
rates of persons 25 and up show that since the peak of the last business cycle (March 2001), the only
group whose employment rates are up is high school dropouts. Those of college graduates are down 1.2
percentage points.

Together, these data show that the wages of college graduates have improved only slightly since 2000 and
have not improved more than high school educated workers. Also, college graduates are now less likely
to be employed than in 2000.

None of this implies that college graduates are worse off than other groups-in some cases, as in employer-
provided health coverage, they have lost less ground than those with less education. But neither are they
insulated from negative trends that have beset the workforce at large, a key point to which we return
below. Equally important, there does not seem to be an insatiable demand by employers for college
graduates that is leading them to improve the wages and benefits of such workers.

We noted above that while increased skill demands were certainly one force in play behind the trend in
the chart, other factors were also driving up the wage gap. For example, less educated workers are more
likely to earn the minimum wage, and its real value fell steeply over the 1980s. Persistent, growing trade
deficits and globalization also dealt a blow to the U.S. manufacturing sector over these years, leading to
the loss of high-quality jobs for non-college-educated workers and putting downward pressure on wages
among similarly skilled workers. Similarly, union representation has been declining, another important
reason for greater inequality. Finally, unemployment was high, on average, over the years when the
premium grew most quickly. When unemployment fell sharply in the latter 1990s, the growth of the wage
gap slowed, suggesting that the absence of full employment, and the diminished bargaining power
associated with slack labor markets, is another factor that must not be overlooked.

In other words, wage inequality is driven by a slew of factors, of which differences in education is but
one. More recently, in the 2000s, the evidence shows no evidence of increasing skill demands, or at least
no evidence that these demands are not being met by enough skilled workers. Instead, in recent years, it
appears the inequality has largely been driven by increased concentration of income and wealth at the
very top of the scale. The current inequality is much more than a simple skills story-persons like CEOs
and holders of large capital assets hold a privileged position that has enabled them to steer the bulk of
growth their way.

Sure, many of these persons have college degrees, but as our and others’ data show, a college degree,
even an advanced degree, does not guarantee entry in this rarified club (see, for example, our analysis  of
recent inequality trends). In fact, our own research shows that half of the growth in wage inequality over

the 1980s, and most of the growth in the 2000s, occurred within education groups, meaning that
inequality’s growth is currently being driven by the gains of some college graduates relative to others
with the same education credentials.

2

Policy makers and analysts must avoid reducing the inequality debate to a sole explanation regarding
education. For any individual making a decision about their future, and for any society contemplating
useful investments, education is an obvious and important area to consider. But it is not solely responsible
for the growth of inequality, not over the longer term, and especially not in recent years. Thus, other
policies-minimum wages, a level playing field for union organizing, health care and pension provision,
work supports for low-income workers, full employment, and responding to the downsides of
globalization-also need to be pursued.

12,""College Premium: Better Pay, Better Prospects

By Catherine Rampell 

February 19, 2013 7:58 pm

I’ve written before about the growing wage premium for college degrees: how the wage
gap between workers with a bachelor’s degree and workers with no more than a high school
diploma has been growing over the years.

But that statistic captures only part of the income premium that people with a bachelor’s

degree enjoy as a result of completing college.

As I report in an article in Wednesday’s paper, people with college diplomas are much
more likely to get jobs, period, than people without the credential. Part of college graduates’
income premium, then, comes from the fact that they are just more likely to be employed in a
typical week. They are probably more likely to work the number of desired hours they wish
to work, too, according to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

You can see this in the unemployment numbers: The jobless rate for people with a

bachelor’s degree was 3.7 percent in January, versus 8.1 percent for those with no more than
a high school diploma.

Census estimates of median annual earnings help capture the college income premium.

In 2011, the median male college graduate earned 1.95 times as much as the median male
whose highest educational attainment was a high school diploma. In 1991, that ratio was
1.76. For women, the ratio is up, but not by as much: It was 2.03 in 2011 versus 1.99 in 1991,
and it dipped in the intervening years.

Here’s a chart showing these earnings ratios over the last two decades:

When I’ve written about this subject before, I’ve been criticized for lumping in people

with advanced degrees with workers with no more than a college diploma, when the job
prospects for those two groups might be very different. But even if you compare the workers

with no more than a college degree with workers with no more than a high school diploma,
the ratio in their median annual earnings has still been rising. (The darker lines in the chart
above refer to the ratio in annual median earnings for workers with exactly a college degree,
and no further education, compared to workers with exactly a high school diploma; the
lighter lines show the ratio for all college grads compared to those with exactly a high school
diploma.)

By the way, the Census Bureau numbers refer only to workers who have at least some

earnings; they exclude people who have no earnings at all. Since a higher percentage of
college grads than high school grads have at least some annual earnings — and since this
differential has increased over the last 20 years, particularly for men — then these Census
earnings numbers will actually understate the increase in the total earnings premium from
college completion, as Mr. Burtless noted to me in an e-mail.

If recent trends continue — with employers increasingly demanding that job candidates

show up to their interview with a sheepskin in hand — we should expect that the wage and
employment advantage conferred upon college grads will only grow.

College can bring a lot of debt, yes. But these figures serve as a reminder that college

also brings huge returns relative to how you might otherwise invest your tuition money.

A META-ANALYSIS OF THE ESTIMATES OF RETURNS TO SCHOOLING IN CHINA

This paper performs a meta-analysis to investigate how changes over time, model specifications, 
differences in data sets, and variable definitions could contribute to the differences in estimates of returns 
to education in China. The results show that approximately 10 percent of the variation can be explained 
by changes in labor market over time, while the other 45 percent can be explained by differences in 
samples used and empirical methods. Return to education has increased approximately 0.2 percentage 
points a year since the economic reform, and increases more quickly as the reform progresses; however, 
this accelerating trend has reached a stop in the last few years when the global recession hit China. We 
also find that returns to education for rural-to-urban migrant workers are 2.3 percentage points lower than 
that of urban workers. We conclude that the increasing reward for human capital accumulation over time 
signals that China is moving toward a well functioning labor market.

1.  Introduction 

 

The labor market reform is one of the most important aspects of China’s market-oriented 

reform since the late 1970s. Prior to 1978, the wage system in pre-reform China deliberately compressed 

wage differentials across skill levels and occupations to provide egalitarian incomes for all workers. 

Under such a system, the conventional pattern of positive returns to education could not prevail. As China 

drifts away from the planned economy, returns to education are likely to rise. Return to education can be 

an indicator to assess the progress of the reform.  

Earlier studies conclude that returns to education in China until the mid-1980s were non-

existent or close to zero (Byron and Manaloto, 1990; Jamison and Van Der Gaag, 1987; Gregory and 

Meng, 1995; Knight and Song, 1991). More recent studies find a positive return to schooling as high as 

10.2% (Li, 2003; Heckman and Li, 2004; de Brauw and Rozelle, 2008; Giles et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 

2007; Maurer-Fazio, 1999; Li et al., 2012). However, it would be too hasty to conclude that China’s labor 

market functions as well as those in market economies. The differences in estimation can arise even 

without an improvement in the true return to education. For example, more recent works often use more 

sophisticated econometric estimation techniques—such as instrumental variable analysis, or twin studies 

with family fixed effects. More recently collected datasets can also have more clearly-defined wage 

variables.  

The objective of this paper is to determine the extent to which the variation in estimates for 

returns to education from different studies could be due to the difference in estimation methods, sampling 

population, data collection, and most importantly, an improvement in labor market conditions in China. 

We decompose the reasons for an increase in returns to education using a meta-analysis estimation. To 

our knowledge, this is the first study to perform a meta-analysis on the returns to schooling in China. To 

construct the meta-data, we first conduct an extensive literature review focusing on papers that provide 

estimates for returns to education starting from 1975, and we find 43 relevant papers and 371 estimates 

for returns to education spanning from 1975 to 2008.  We record the empirical method used, the 

 

1 

characteristics of the sample population, the year the data was collected and whether the regressions 

include specific sets of controls for each of the regression estimates. To extend the estimate to a more 

current period, we include our own estimations of return to education using the 1991 to 2009 waves of 

China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).  

We find that approximately 10 percent of the variation in estimates for return to education can 

be explained by changes in labor market over time, while the other 45 percent can be explained by 

differences in samples used and empirical methods.  The returns to education are close to zero in both 

urban and rural areas in the early stage of reform, but they have increased at 0.21 percentage points a year 

in the past 30 years. More interestingly, we find that return to education increases more quickly as the 

reform progresses; however, this accelerating trend has reached a stop in the last few years when the 

global recession hit China. This increasing trend is similar for both urban and rural, male and female sub-

samples. One note is that we also find that returns to education for rural-to-urban migrant workers are 2.3 

percentage points lower than that of urban workers.  

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the background of China’s 

labor market before and after the reform separated by urban and rural areas. Section 3 provides an 

overview of the econometric framework used in the existing literature. Section 4 describes the dataset for 

meta-analysis and the estimates of returns to education using the CHNS dataset.  Section 5 presents the 

results from the meta-analysis and Section 6 concludes. 

 

2.  Background of the labor market in China 

 

The late political scientist Gordon White once said that of all planning aspects of China prior to 

the reform, “the allocation of labor resources is by far the furthest from the market mechanism” (White, 

1988). In this section, we will provide some description about various reforms that took place in urban 

and rural labor markets.   

2.1 Urban Labor Market 

 

2 

               Before the market-oriented reform in 1978, the Bureau of Labor and Personnel had immense 

power since it was in charge of job assignments. For a typical urban resident, upon completing some 

education level, she would be assigned to work in one of the state agencies, which can be state-owned 

enterprises (SOE) or government institutions (Cai 2003). Her initial assignment of work unit would be 

determined by her education attainment, field of studies, and at times her family class origin.1 Besides her 

work unit, she would be assigned as a factory worker/technician (gongren/jigong) or an administrative or 

managerial worker (ganbu). The initial assignment is extremely important since job change across work 

places or even within a workplace was very rare (Knight and Song, 1991).  

Her wage was determined through a wage grade system: eight grades for factory 

workers/technicians and 24 to 28 grades for administrative and managerial workers (Meng and Kid, 1997; 

Zhang et al., 2005).2  Being promoted to a higher wage grade depended on seniority (Knight and Song, 

1991; 1999). Thus her monthly wages did not really reflect her ability and productivity. Her wage would 

be kept at a low level (Zhang et al., 2005), but she would receive various benefits and in-kind transfers, 

including food and housing rationing, free education for her family, medical care and pension.3  Such a 

wage system ensured every urban worker a lifetime employment (as known as “iron rice bowl”, 

tiefanwan), especially because employers could not recruit and dismiss workers freely (Meng and Kid, 

1997). 

                                                 
1 The family class origin depends on one’s family background during China’s Civil War with the Kuomingtan. 
Family class origin can be categorized into “Five Red Elements” (hongwulei), “Middle Class” or “Five Black 
Elements” (heiwulei). “Five Red Elements” refers to the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary cadres, 
production workers, poor peasants, extremely poor and mid-lower peasants. The “Five Red Elements” enjoyed the 
highest social and political status as well as the most government-provided resources (including better education and 
employment opportunity) during the cultural revolution between 1966 to 1976. Middle class were pre-liberation 
peddlers and store clerks, and former middle-class peasants.  “Five Black Elements” includes landlords, rich farmers 
and counter-revolutionaries. (Deng and Treiman, 1997). 
2 Various papers report different number of grades. Knight and Song (1991) report that factory workers were divided 
into 8 grades, technicians were divided into 17 grades and administrative and managerial workers (ganbu) were 
divided into 20 grades. This probably was due to the fact that the wage system was first established in 1956 and 
adjusted several times in 1963, 1971-1972, 1977-1978 and 1978-1979.  
3 Since wages were kept low, benefits and in-kind transfers were an important part of total income. However, market 
value of these benefits and in-kind transfers were difficult to estimate precisely, especially when the commodity 
markets hardly exist. We would like to point out that in most earlier studies on returns to education, the true returns 
to education in pre-reform China could be underestimated since these benefits and in-kind transfers could also 
depend on one’s education level (Peng, 1992).  

 

3 

The urban labor market reform started in the late 1970s following the commodity market reform. 

We will describe the labor market reform from three dimensions: the introduction of labor contract, the 

wage reform and mass lay-off of workers from state-owned enterprises.  

The introduction of labor contracts dismantled the “iron rice bowl” and allowed job mobility. 

Starting in 1983, graduates could choose either to be assigned by the Bureau of Labor and Personnel or 

they were allowed to seek employment opportunities in both state agencies and private firms (Brook and 

Tao, 2003).  In the same year, a labor contract system was introduced to selected SOE new employees 

(Knight and Song, 1991). 4 A typical contract specified the duration, the responsibilities, and the benefits 

of employment. Most importantly, either party could choose not to renew this contract when it expired 

(Liu, 1998). In 1985, less than four percent of the urban labor force had a contract (Meng, 2004). In 1986, 

a new order was issued by the government and the new labor contract system gradually spread to all 

SOEs (Meng and Kidd, 1997). By 1995, nearly 40 percent of the urban labor force was under contract 

(Meng, 2000).  

         As for wage reform, the transition from a wage grade system to a more flexible wage system started 

in the early 1980s. Under the new wage system, the wage of each employee has three main components: 

basic wage (jibengongzi), functional wage (gangweigongzi) and floating wage (jiangging). The basic 

wage was derived from the old wage grade system; the functional wage depends on one’s position in the 

firm; and the floating wage, which was determined at the firm level, was a flexible element that reflected 

individual performance and employer’s profitability (Knight and Song, 2003). The share of basic wage 

declined rather slowly from 86 percent in 1978 to 56 percent in 1988 and to 47 percent in 1993.  

The central government implemented a series of reforms in SOE aiming to improve the efficiency of 

the state sector. In particular, middle- and large-sized SOE and collectively-owned enterprises laid off 

over 25 million employees from 1997 to 2002 (also known as xiagang). Most of these workers were 

middle-aged workers with low skills and poor education (Maurer-Fazio and Dinh, 2004). The government 
                                                 
4 In 1981, the earliest experiment of the labor contract was implemented in selected SOE in Guangdong, Jiangsu and 
Shanghai (Meng and Kidd, 1997). These labor contracts did not cover existing employees. (China Ministry of Labor 
and Social Security, 1998). 

 

4 

established re-employment centers to help the laid-off workers to find jobs. Employment was no longer 

guaranteed, and one’s education level played an important role during this re-employment process and in 

the determination of their earnings in private sectors (Maurer-Fazio and Dinh, 2004). Those workers who 

could not find jobs in the first few years after being laid off received some governmental supports.5, 6 

2.2 Rural Nonfarm Labor Market 

               Prior to the reform, both the rural agricultural and off-farm production were operated under a 

three-tier system. The three-tier system consists of three administrative and production tiers: People’s 

commune (gongshe), brigade (lv), and production team (shengchandui).7 Under the three-tier system, 

commune and brigade leaders determined all economic activities, including production plans, agricultural 

and industrial inputs, labor assignments and output distribution. Each individual was assigned to a 

production team and worked on a farm or at a local factory. 8 The rural non-farm sector did not play a 

major role in the pre-reform period. Most rural industries were opened and operated by local communes 

and brigades to provide sideline agricultural products and services, such as agricultural machinery, farm 

tools, chemical fertilizer and handicrafts (Meng, 2000; Zhang et al., 2004). For their off-farm work, 

farmers were paid under a work point system. Points were given to members for each day of work.  The 

number of points a person could receive in a day was determined by his or her gender, age and health 

status (e.g. healthy, young men normally received higher points per day of work). Education and 

productivity were irrelevant for one’s pay.  

           Starting in 1983, these collective enterprises (previously owned by a commune, brigade or 

production team) were renamed as Township and Village-owned Enterprises (TVE, xiangzhenqiye) and 

they were given more freedom in production planning, wage schedules and recruitment. TVE could hire 
                                                 
5 The unemployment and social security systems were established in 1986, but they were not enforced until 1993. A 
small allowance was provided to SOE laid-off workers.  
6 There were many other concurrent reforms that can have some impact on the labor market, such as pension reform 
and the expansion of college education. Since they are not the focus of this paper, we do not discuss them here. 
Leung (2003) provides a detailed description of the pension reforms.   
7 People’s commune was set up in the mid-1950s in rural China. The population of a typical commune ranged from 
15,000 to 30,000 while the average size of a team was about 167 people. (Gregory and Meng 1995; Li and Zhang 
1998) 
8 The term “enterprise” (qiye) was hardly used in pre-reform China because the term was connected to capitalism. 
These collectively-owned factories are the predecessors of town and village enterprises during the reform. 

 

5 

local off-farm laborers as full time employees, and this was possible because of the concurrent 

agricultural reform—known as the  “Household Responsibility System” (Lin, 1992). 9  With the 

“household responsibility system” and the improvement in agricultural production efficiency, much of 

rural farming labor now became free. TVE absorbed a large portion of rural laborers and become a major 

employer in the rural non-farm labor market. Between 1978 and 2000, the number of rural non-farm 

worker grew from 21.8 to 151.6 million (Fleisher et al. 2003). 10  The work-point wage system in pre-

reformed rural collectives was replaced by a piece-rate wage system under which monthly wages were 

determined based on individual work effort and enterprise profits (Meng, 1996; Fleisher and Wang, 

2004).11 

              Prior to reform, rural-urban labor mobility was strictly prevented under the household 

registration system, also known as hukou. Since jobs were assigned centrally, without an urban hukou, a 

rural resident simply could not obtain a job in an urban area (Liang and Ma, 2003). Most people born into 

a rural community stayed there for their entire life. An important part of the reforms was the weakening 

of the household registration system. Starting in 1983, the central government gradually relaxed the 

restrictions on mobility, and rural residents were allowed to seek jobs in nearby urban enterprises. The 

restriction on rural-urban labor mobility was further relaxed when the government allowed rural residents 

to seek jobs in any city in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Cai, 2003; Fleisher and Yang, 2003; de Brauw 

and Rozelle, 2008).12 As a result, a massive rural to urban migration has taken place. According to Zhao 

                                                 
9 China’s economic reform in the agricultural sector first started by introducing the “Household Responsibility 
System” (HRS). Each production team could now divide the collectively-owned land and rent out to its member 
households for up to 15 years (then extended to another 30 years in 1990s) (Wang, 2007). Under the “Household 
Responsibility System”, households’ responsibility to the government is to fulfill the grain procurement quota 
(gongliang). Households could make their own farming decisions such as the amount of input used, type of grains 
planted, etc, and any output above the quota could be sold in the market and households could keep the profits. 
Between 1978 and 1995, total grain yield increased 3% annually and rural household income increased 7.3% 
annually (Meng, 2000).  
10 While the government did encourage skilled craftsmen to establish their own businesses in 1983-1985 (Fleisher 
and Yang 2003; de Brauw et al. 2002), the share of the labor force that worked in private sectors for both rural and 
urban areas was still less than 1 percent by the late 1980s (National Bureau of Statistics, 1990).   
11 Byrd and Lin (1989) provide  more elaborate details about the post-reform rural industry. 
12 Several major reforms are relevant for labor mobility as follows: in 1985, the procurement quota was replaced by 
the new purchasing contracts between the state and rural households. Under the new system, rural residents do not 
have the obligation to fulfill the grain production quota (Fleisher and Yang, 2006). Second, starting in 1986, the 

 

6 

(2000) and Meng et al. (2010), the estimated number of rural-urban migrants is approximately 12.1 

million during 1980-1985 and this number reached 38.9 million in 1997.13 Starting in 1997, the migrants 

with stable source of income and housing could apply for urban hukou, but this policy was mainly applied 

to small towns and medium-sized cities. In most provincial capital cities and metropolitan areas, such as 

Beijing and Shanghai, the chance of obtaining an urban hukou for rural migrants is still very slim (Brook 

and Tao, 2003; Fleisher and Yang, 2006). By 2000, an estimated 61.3 million rural residents had moved 

to urban areas, while this number reached 125.8 million by 2006 (Meng et al., 2010).  

A few studies suggest that rural migrants are being discriminated against in the urban labor 

market.  Using the data collected in Shanghai in 1995/1996, Meng and Zhang (2001) find that rural 

migrants mostly take jobs that the urban residents are unwilling to take. Even when the rural migrants 

work in the same enterprise as the urban workers, they are also paid less. While the Chinese government 

passed laws protecting workers in the late 1990s and 2000s, including regulations on contract, insurance, 

work hours, etc., Frijters et al. (2010) use data from 2008 and find that rural migrant workers still work 

longer working hours and receive lower wages and worse remuneration packages compared to their urban 

counterparts. Using a 2002 dataset, a study by Demurger et al. (2009) tries to break down urban residents’ 

and migrants’ earning differentials, and they suggest that most of the differences in migrant and urban 

workers’ earnings can be explained by the differences in individual characteristics—such as education.   

Figure 1 plots the distribution of full-time workers at SOE, TVE and private sectors. As shown in 

Figure 1, prior to the reform, SOE were the biggest employers and absorbed nearly 80% of urban labor. In 

                                                                                                                                                             
central government started issuing identification cards (shenfenzheng) and rural citizens with a legal I.D. card could 
freely migrate to cities.  In 1993, the urban food rationing system was abolished and migrants with rural hukou could 
buy food and other goods in urban commodity markets (Cai, 2003). However, even today there are still other 
institutional barriers stopping rural residents from moving to urban areas. For example, only those with urban hukou 
can send their children to urban public school and enjoy urban resident health insurance. For difficulties faced by 
migrant workers see Chapter 2 and Chapter 5 of Meng, Manning, Li and Effendi (2010).  
13 According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the Ministry of Agriculture (2001), the total “floating 
population” (liudongrenkou) was approximately 20 million in 1983 while this number reached 30 million in 1987 
and 70 million in 1995. Comparing to the official statistics, the estimates from Zhao (2000) and Meng et al. (2010) 
seem small. However, the “floating population” in the official NBS statistics covers all internal migrants—including 
rural-rural, rural-urban and urban-urban migrants (Duan and Sun 2006).

3.  Mincer Equation and Returns to Education Literature in China 

The standard labor economics model of estimating returns to education is the Mincer equation 

(1974):

(1) 

where yi  is the earnings of individual i, Si is a measure of schooling, Xi’ is a vector of covariates such as 

experience and the quadratic term of experience, and μi is an error term. The main outcome of interest in 

this study is β, the coefficient on education. Among the papers estimating the Mincer equation in China, 

several empirical methods are employed, and we discuss their methodologies in detail in this Section.  

            

3.1.  OLS estimation and Unobserved Ability 

The basic assumption of OLS estimation for Mincer equation (1) is that the explanatory variables 

are uncorrelated with the error term, μi. However, this assumption may be violated. For example, 

individual ability, which could be a determinant of wage, is missing from the Mincer equation. Ability 

can be correlated with education, which leads to a biased estimate of β. One approach to resolve the 

potential bias is to directly control for ability using some proxies. The proxies that have been used include 

parental education and parental income (Heckman and Li, 2004; Li and Luo, 2004; de Brauw and Rozelle, 

2008; Giles et al., 2007). However, the inclusions of these proxies are not without criticism. There could 

still be aspects of ability that are not captured in one’s parental education/skills.  

3.2.   Twins data and Other Unobserved Variables  

                                                 
14 Zhang et al. (2005) provides an extensive overview of returns to education for state sector, collective sector and 
non-public (non-state) sector from 1988-2001. According to their estimates, the return to education in the private 
sector was higher than that of state and TVE sectors during this period. Private firms have more flexibility in labor 
hiring and wage schedule and the scale of the private sector grew quickly. 

 

8 

In addition to ability, other unobserved family characteristics could also be correlated with 

individual education level and earnings. One innovative approach that attempts to address this issue is the 

use of twins samples. The key idea of twins studies is that monozygotic twins should be similar in family 

upbringing and genetically determined ability. Unobserved differences that bias our estimate of β can be 

eliminated with the use of family fixed effects.15  This approach has been pursued in estimating the return 

to education in the United States and the United Kingdom (Ashenfelter and Krueger, 1994; Behrman et al., 

1994; Ashenfelter and Rouse, 1998; Bonjour et al., 2003).  

In China, the datasets including large numbers of twins were not available until the Chinese 

Twins Survey (Li et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012). The Chinese Twins Survey was 

conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in summer 2002 in five cities (Chengdu, 

Chongqing, Harbin, Hefei and Wuhan). It contains information on earnings, education, and job tenure for 

488 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins and 322 pairs of non-identical (DZ) twins.16  One potential problem 

with twin studies is that measurement error problems can be exacerbated by fixed-effect estimates.  The 

Chinese Twins Survey follows Ashenfelter and Krueger’s US Twins Survey design (1994) by asking each 

twin to report their own education level as well as their co-twin’s education level. 

With the Chinese Twins Survey, Zhang et al. (2007) and Li et al. (2007) both use the twins 

dataset to estimate various versions of Mincer Equation. In order to deal with the measure error issue, Li 

et al. (2012) use the cross-reported education by the other twin to instrument for the self-reported 

education level.  

 

3.3.  2SLS and Natural Experiment 

Another approach used to improve on OLS estimates is two-stage least square method (2SLS). 

This approach requires an instrumental variable that is related to one’s education level, but is orthogonal 
                                                 
15 In fact, the variation in education level between twins may be endogenous. For instance, the between-twin 
difference in birth weight is correlated with their IQ and schooling. See Bound and Solon (1999) and Neumark 
(1999) for more discussion.   
16 They consider a pair of twins to be identical if both twins respond that they have identical hair color, looks and 
gender.

to one’s ability. Instruments used in the previous studies include quarter of birth interacted with year of 

birth (Angrist and Krueger, 1991), a school expansion program (Duflo, 2002), and geographical distance 

to schools (Kane and Rouse, 1993; Card 1995).  

In the context of China, both Fleisher and Wang (2005) and Giles et al. (2007) use the differential 

impact of the Cultural Revolution (CR) across time and geographic variation in China as an instrumental 

variable for years of schooling.  During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, formal education was 

disrupted. Many universities were closed for six years and some age cohorts missed as much as eight 

years of schooling (Meng and Gregory, 2002a). Rural schooling was less affected than urban schooling 

(Meng and Gregory, 2002b).  Since there are differences in educational disruption across age cohorts and 

rural/urban areas, Fleisher and Wang (2005) instrument years of schooling with birth year, location (rural, 

small town, medium-size city or metropolitan area), a dummy variable indicating whether any normal 

high-school years occurred during the CR and interaction terms between the location and CR-year 

variable.  

Giles et al. (2007) note that besides the variation in time and location, family background was 

also a key factor in determining the impact of CR on schooling. For example, the children of “Five Black 

Elements” were hit harder than the children of “Five Red Elements”17, and the children whose parents had 

administrative status (ganbu) were less likely to be sent to the countryside. Giles et al. (2007) construct 

different education disruption measures as instruments based on one’s birth place, birth year and parental 

administrative status.18  

3.4  Selection Bias 

One possible source of bias in estimates of the returns to schooling is selection bias (Heckman 

and Li, 2004; de Brauw and Rozelle, 2008; Wang et al., 2009). One example of this is that people sort 

into school based on the heterogeneous return to schooling. For example, those who attend college are the 
                                                 
17 See Footnote 1 for more discussion.   
18 Meng and Gregory (2002) also study the impact of disrupted education during the CR on adult earnings. Since 
they could not control for unobserved cohort differences that are correlated with workers’ experience of schooling, 
shock and workers’ productivity, their findings cannot be extrapolated beyond the impact of the CR on earnings for 
that particular cohort.    

 

10 

ones who know that they will receive higher return to schooling. Using semi-parametric methods, 

Heckman and Li (2004) allow for heterogeneous returns among individuals selecting into schooling based 

on these differences.  Heckman and Li (2004) find that the heterogeneity in returns is substantial in the 

population. OLS gives a downward biased estimate of the average treatment effect. Wang et al. (2009) 

use the same methodology as Heckman and Li (2004) but with a different dataset.  

de Brauw and Rozelle (2007) suggest another type of selection bias. An individual will not enter 

a labor market if his or her reservation wage is higher than the wage offered. The distribution of wages is 

left truncated, thus the OLS estimates will be biased if not correcting for the selection bias. To account for 

the bias, they apply a two-stage Heckman correction method.   

 

4.  Meta-Dataset and Summary Statistics 

In order to construct the meta-dataset, we performed a literature search on the Social Science 

Research Network (SSRN) to identify studies that use the Mincer equation to estimate the returns to 

education in China. We further expanded the list by including any relevant papers mentioned in the set of 

papers we found from SSRN. We found 43 papers that estimate returns to education in China spanning 

the period from 1975 to 2008.19   

In Table 1, we present the estimates by whether the sample populations are urban, rural or 

migrants.20  The estimates reported in Table 1 are either taken directly from the most comparable 

estimation from that study, or they represent the average across several specifications within the same 

study.21 For those studies that use a set of level of education attainment dummies, instead of years of 

                                                 
19 A paper by Fleisher et al. (2011) is not listed in Table 1 and is excluded from our analysis even though they have 
some estimates of returns to schooling, because  the approach is quite different from what we have discussed above. 
Unlike the rest of the papers using individual level data to estimate returns, Fleisher et al. (2011) estimate marginal 
product of skilled labor (MPL) in Cobb-Douglas function and impute the returns to education using MPL.  
20 To our knowledge, there are very few datasets that would allow one to examine the returns to education for a 
migrant population. In recent years, the most structured and representative migrant dataset is the Rural-Urban 
Migration in China and Indonesia (RUMiCI) project. It is a dataset that starts in 2008 and will contain five rounds of 
longitudinal surveys on migrant workers. More information can be found at: http://rse.anu.edu.au/rumici/. 
21 For example, Johnson and Chow (1997) present three estimates for returns to education in urban areas. The first 
one is the basic OLS, and the second includes an interaction term between being a member of the communist party 
and work experience, and the third one includes an interaction term between female and schooling. We choose to 

 

11 

schooling, as independent variables, we annualize the returns across education categories (university, high 

school, middle school and elementary school) to get the average return for a year of schooling. We only 

include the rural studies if they pertained to the off-farm sector.  

            To provide a more current measure of the return to schooling, we estimate Equation (1) using the 

dataset from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The CHNS is a panel survey which covers 

approximately 16,000 individuals in nine provinces in the years 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 

2006 and 2009.22 The 1989 data is excluded from the analysis since the format of the questions on wages 

was changed, making it less comparable to that of later years. The OLS estimates of returns to education 

for both urban and rural areas are provided in Table 2. Table 2 shows that returns to education increase 

over time for both urban and rural off-farm sectors and this increasing trend came to a stop in 2009.  We 

incorporate these estimates into our meta-dataset.23  

Most studies listed in Table 1 have multiple estimates of returns to schooling. For each estimate, 

we would record the model specification (IV, OLS), special correction (ability controls, correction for 

selection bias), the choice of the dependent variable24 (hourly wage, monthly/annual wage, includes in-

kind transfer, subsidies), sample used in regression (female only, male only, pooled; urban only, rural 

only, migrant only; twin), the choices of controls (occupations dummies included, industry dummies 

included, work unit dummies included) and the year the dataset was collected. For example, Zhang et al. 

(2005) estimate the return to schooling for each year from 1988 to 2001.  Their study also provides 

estimation results using alternative specifications such as controlling for industry dummies and 
                                                                                                                                                             
only present the estimate from the basic OLS without any interaction terms, which is more comparable to that of 
other studies.  
22 The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is a project between the Carolina Population Center and the 
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey uses a multistage, random cluster sampling process.. 
CHNS contains detailed demographic, socioeconomic and health information for 4,400 households with a total of 
26,000 individuals.  
23 Unfortunately, we are not able to test the difference between IV and OLS estimates using this dataset due to the 
absence of a good instrument. 
24 Several authors suggest that hourly wage is better than annual or monthly earnings because it does not depend on 
the number of hours worked (Shultz, 1988; Card, 1999). In particular, Li and Zax (2004) find that less educated 
individuals work more in China. Without taking work hours into account, we may underestimate the return to 
education. Thus, the choice of dependent variable matters.  Moreover, earning can be broadly defined to include 
bonuses, subsidies and in-kind transfers as a part of total earning. In the appendix table, we show that inclusion of 
bonuses, subsidies and in-kind transfers does not have a significant impact on estimates for returns to education. 

 

12 

occupation dummies, and separating by gender and different sectors. Therefore, we include a total of 112 

estimates from this study into our meta-dataset, but each of the estimates is unique in some dimension in 

our meta-dataset. In order to assign the same weight to all studies, we create a weighting function which 

is inversely proportional to the number of estimates included from a given study. It is also notable that a 

large fraction of the urban studies use a dataset from 1988. This is because only a handful of micro-level 

datasets are suitable and accessible and can be used to estimate returns to education in China.25 

Table 3 reports the descriptive statistics for the meta-dataset, broken down by urban and rural 

areas. The earliest year that the data covers is 1975 in the urban areas (pre-reform) and 1986 in the rural 

areas (post-reform). The average number of observations in a regression is 3,309 and the average return to 

schooling is 4.8 percent. There are a few other noteworthy aspects of this table.  First, the average return 

to each year of schooling in urban area is about 2.8 percentage points higher than that of the rural off-farm 

sector.26 Second, none of the IV and twins studies were conducted using a rural dataset. There is also no 

rural study that includes industry dummies and estimates for employees in SOE and private sectors and 

rural migrant workers. There are very few studies with migrant samples, so we cannot examine the trend 

of return to schooling for the migrant population. Despite that we discuss the potential bias associated 

with using annual/monthly earning as the dependent variable, only 30 percent of estimates use log of 

hourly wage as the dependent variable. In many of the earlier surveys, hours worked are simply not 

available. In our analysis, we examine whether using hourly wage as opposed to annual/monthly income 

would affect the estimates for returns to education. 

                                                 
25 For example, the dataset from the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) was one of the most popular choices 
for estimating the Mincer equation. It covered four cross-sectional datasets collected in 1988/89, 1995/96, 
1999/2000 and 2002/2003. The sample consists of 17,000 workers in 10 provinces in 1988, 10,913 workers in 11 
provinces in 1995, 6,281 workers in six provinces in 1999 and 9,791 workers in twelve provinces in 2002. It was 
collected by the Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Science.  
26 In studies that measure education using a set of dummies for level of attainment, instead of years of schooling as 
the independent variable, we first sum over rates of return on dummies (university, high school, middle school and 
elementary school) and annualize the sum to estimate the average return to additional year of schooling.   

 

13 

 

In the next section, we provide the meta-analysis to examine whether the difference in 

estimations among studies can be explained by various model specifications, the passage of time and 

differences in datasets.  

 

5.  Meta-Analysis of the Returns to Schooling Literature  

5.1.  Meta-Analysis Regression Strategy  

Meta-regression analysis is a quantitative method used to analyze a body of related empirical 

literature (Stanley and Jarrell, 1989). One advantage of meta-analysis is that it allows us to quantify the 

changes in coefficient estimates due to differences in empirical specifications used across various studies .  

For example, we can estimate the effect of the inclusion of occupation or industry dummies, or the impact 

of using IV as opposed to OLS on returns to education. It also allows us to examine how returns to 

education have evolved over time by surveying the vast literature in returns to schooling.    

Figure 3 plots the returns over time from the studies included in the meta-analysis; each point 

represents one observation.  The figure reveals an upward trend of returns to schooling over time. The 

few outliers on this figure are from either Heckman and Li (2004) or Wang et al. (2009). As we discuss in 

Section 3, both of these papers correct for selection bias and more importantly, they estimate the returns 

to schooling for college students. It is likely possible that returns to per-year schooling are much higher at 

college level.  In Figure 4, we plot the returns by the area of sample population (urban vs. rural), 

empirical model (OLS vs. IV) and gender (male vs. female), and this upward trend can be observed in 

each of the subgroups. Therefore, we include a time factor in our meta-regression.27  

The meta-regression model can be expressed as follows:

where βijt is the estimated returns to each year of schooling for study i and specification j using dataset 

from year t. We subtract t from 1975, the first year in which return of education is estimated. 1 estimates 
                                                 
27 While it may appear that heteroskedasticity exists, it is possibly due to the fact that very few studies cover the 
earlier period.

the change in returns to schooling across years. Z′ij is a vector of independent variables including ability 

bias control, selection bias control, the use of instrumental variables, twin method, hourly wages as 

dependent variable, occupation, industry, work unit dummies and the specific dataset (CHIP), urban, male, 

female, and migrant dummies indicating whether the estimate is for a specific sub-population. Since there 

are usually multiple observations from each study, unless otherwise noted, the regression standard errors 

are clustered at the study level. As mentioned earlier, the weight of each observation is inversely 

proportional to the number of estimates included in each study, so in each regression each study should 

have the same weight. 

 

5.2.  Main Results: 

Table 4 reports the results for estimating Equation 2. Column 1 estimates Equation 2 exclude 

the time trend, Column 2 estimates Equation 2. We find that differences in econometric specifications 

alone account for nearly 45 percent of the variation in estimates for returns to schooling. When we 

include the time dimension, we can explain an additional 10 percent more of the variation. Coefficient on 

time dimension suggests that returns to education increase at 0.21 percentage points a year between 1975 

and 2009.   

Returns to education that are estimated using instrumental variables are about 3.2-3.6 

percentage points higher than those from OLS. Those studies which use hourly wage instead of 

annual/monthly earning as a dependent variable find higher returns to schooling. We should also note that 

most of the studies with hourly wage available are collected more recently, so once we control for time, 

this coefficient becomes insignificant in Column 2. There are three papers controlling for selection bias 

(Heckman and Li, 2004; Wang et al., 2009; de Brauw and Rozelle, 2008), and the coefficient on selection 

bias is positive and significant. However, one should be cautious to interpret the coefficient as if it is only 

due to the selection bias. While all other studies estimate returns to schooling for all levels of education, 

two out of three papers that correct for selection bias estimate returns to schooling for university students. 

It is possible that return to per-year schooling is higher for college than other levels, thus the positive 

 

15 

significant coefficients on selection bias are partly due to the college student bias. We include a set of 

dummies indicating whether a study controls for occupation, industry and work unit (SOE, TVE or 

Private). Since occupational, industry and work units are various channels by which education can affect 

wages, the inclusion of these dummies also affects one’s estimates in returns to schooling. Fifteen out of 

44 studies use the CHIP dataset, so we include a dummy for that, but it is not significant. The estimated 

return to education in urban areas is about 2 percentage points higher than in the rural areas. Male and 

female dummies indicate if this estimate is specifically for male or female, and the default is the pooled 

sample. Return to education for male is negative but significant suggesting that return to education for 

female is probably higher than male.28 The migrant dummy equals 1 if the sample population is rural-

urban migrant workers. The return to education for rural migrants is 2.39 percentage points lower than 

non-migrant workers.   

Since returns to education have been increasing over time, it would be interesting to see if this 

increasing trend has slowed. Column 3 includes a quadratic term for the time variable. If this term has a 

positive sign, it means that returns to education accelerate in the period of our study. The coefficient on 

the quadratic time variable is positive but insignificant. With the consideration of the recent global 

recession, we exclude the estimates from year 2008 and 2009 in Column 4. It shows that the year square 

term is significantly positive, which indicates that the trend of increasing returns to education is 

accelerating until 2007, when it reaches a stop.29  

In Table 5 we examine whether this increasing trend differs by subsample. Table 5 Columns 1 

and 2 report the results separated by urban versus rural samples; Columns 3 and 4 report results for male 

and female samples. The returns to schooling increase slightly faster in rural areas than urban areas, and 

return to schooling increases faster for female than for male. One striking pattern is that migrant male 

                                                 
28 The finding of higher returns to female education has been documented in the previous literature (Psacharopoulos, 
1994; Li, 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). This difference could be partially due to the greater positive self-selection of 
women into the labor force compared to men (Zhang et al., 2005), and also due to the under-supply of educated 
women on the labor market (Li, 2003). 
29 In the appendix we provide some alternative specifications where we do not use sample weight or do not cluster 
standard errors, and we find consistent patterns. 

 

16 

workers receive about 5 percentage points lower returns to schooling than non-migrant male workers; 

migrant female workers’ returns to schooling are about 6 percentage points lower than non-migrant 

female workers.   

In Table 6, we want to investigate the non-linearity of the increasing return to schooling over 

time. We restrict our sample to only those using an urban, non-migrant sample and divide estimates into 4 

periods: 1975-1988, 1989-1995, 1996-2002 and 2003-2009.30 We did not use a sample weight nor cluster 

the standard errors since there is one paper that produced returns to education for an urban non-migrant 

sample after 2003. Our findings suggest that during the early period of reform in 1975-1988 and 1989-

1995, the returns to education increased at 0.299 percentage and 0.236 percentage points per year, 

respectively.31 Between 1996 and 2002, the returns to education increase at 0.50 percentage points a year, 

but eventually it plateaus in more recent years. In Column 5, we extend the period in Column 3 until 2006, 

and we still find a positive trend even until then. Since there is no data on 2007, we can infer that the 

negative insignificant sign in Column 4 is driven by estimates from 2008 and 2009 when the global 

recession affected China.32 

 

6.  Conclusion 

This study examines the trend of returns to education in China from 1975 to 2009 by 

performing a meta-regression analysis using estimates from over 40 studies. Nearly 45 percent of the 

variation in returns to education is due to the differences in econometric specifications from studies, and 

time progression can explain about 10 percent of the variation. At the onset of the reform, return to 
                                                 
30 This division is based on the consideration of important policy changes and sample size issue. For example, 1975-
1988 is the early stage of reform and many studies use data in 1988. Around 1987 there was a contract law reform, 
and after 1987 the rural-urban migration restriction was gradually relaxed. Around 1997 most large- and medium-
sized SOE laid off many unskilled workers (xiagang) and another wave of wage system reform took place in all 
state sectors.  
31 These two coefficients are not statistically different from each other.   
32 We also add three dummy variables—“Bonus Included”, “Subsidy Included” and “In-kind Transfer Included” into 
our meta-regression, to indicate if wage measure includes bonus, subsidy or in-kind transfer. However, none of these 
variables is significant and results are reported in the Appendix Table. A small set of papers examine return to 
education by work unit (state-owned enterprise, town-village-enterprise and private enterprise). Regression results 
reported in the Appendix suggest that the return to education in private sector is significantly higher (2.2 percentage 
points) than those in SOE, and return to education in TVE is 0.93 percentage points lower than SOE. 

 

17 

education was close to 0, but it has been increasing at 0.2 percentage points per year in the past 30 years. 

Our empirical results show that this upward time trend persists in both urban and rural areas and for both 

male and female. More importantly, for urban workers, this increasing time trend showed no sign of 

abating until 2008 and 2009 when the global recession began to affect China. Our empirical results show 

that this upward time trend persists in both urban and rural areas and for both male and female. However, 

it ought to be of interest and concern to policymakers that rural-to-urban migrant workers receive much 

lower return to education  compared to their urban counterparts.   

An extrapolation of the existing trends into the year 2015 gives the predicted return of 8.44 

percent.  The magnitudes of these returns are equal or close to the levels observed in other Asian 

countries during the period of the 1970s and 1980s (Psacharopoulos, 1994). Increasing rewards for human 

capital accumulation is a positive sign that suggests China is moving gradually towards a market 

economy.

Note: We plot those estimated returns by region, empirical model and gender. In the upper panel, returns 
in urban areas increase more quickly over time than returns in rural areas; in the middle panel, OLS

Note: Each return is derived from a separate regressions. In Column (1) and (2), the dependent 
variable is the log of monthly basic wage from the primary job. In Column (3) and (4), the dependent 
variable is log(hourly wage), and hourly wage is imputed using earning divided by hours worked. We 
restrict to sample older than 18. In Column (1), the covariates includes exp, (exp)2, minority, female, 
province dummies and ownership dummies.  Column (2) includes all covariates listed above plus 
occupation dummies. In Columns (3) and (4), the dependent variable is log (hourly wage). Column (4) 
adds occupation dummies.
 a: Not statistically significant from zero.

9,"Eroding Returns in College Education
by FRED SIEGMUND

A good financial return for a college education should not be assumed as it
once was. Chances remain high that college will pay, but changes in tuition
and labor markets are lowering the return and raising the risk it might not pay
for all graduates. Higher and higher tuition, delays finding jobs and the course
of study head a list of trouble spots to consider when making a college
investment.

Tuition

All the states have one and usually two public universities that offer the best
opportunity to measure tuition inflation. Private colleges tend to have higher
tuition than public colleges, but they are more likely to offer discounts to
attract good students away from the less expensive public colleges.
Competition for good students means the posted tuition at private colleges
may not be a good measure of actual tuition paid, or its rate of increase.
Public colleges are less likely to discount tuition than private colleges, which
makes them a better measure of tuition increases.

Compare the 2002 tuition for the two largest state universities in each of the
fifty states with the tuition of 2013. Some like the University of Arizona have
tuition increases at rates that range up to five times the rate of inflation. For
example, if the 2002 tuition of $2,490 at the University of Arizona increased
by the rate of inflation until 2013, it would be $3,224.80. Instead it is $10,391,
an increase of 317.31 percent, which is an annual compounded increase of
13.87 percent when the general inflation rate was 2.38 percent in the same
years. (1)

The high percentage increase at the University of Arizona results partly from
its relatively low 2002 tuition. The lower 2002 tuition exaggerates the
percentage increase over the period but I can find 31 state colleges out of the
hundred that have higher tuition than the University of Arizona. Take the
University of Vermont. If its 2002 tuition of $8,994 increased by the rate of
inflation until 2013, it would be $11,648.13. Instead it is $15,718, an increase
of 74.76 percent, which is a annual compounded percent increase of 5.21
percent, one of the lower rates of increase of tuition for the 100 colleges
reviewed.

All of the hundred colleges mentioned above had tuition increases higher than
the 2.38 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. All but seven had
increases at least twice the rate of inflation; forty-nine had tuition increases at
least three times the rate of inflation.

Wages

Wage for jobs that need BA degree skills need to go up as fast as tuition to
avoid lowering the rate of return on a college education. The Bureau of Labor

Statistics (BLS) identifies occupations and careers that need BA degree
skills. (2)

In 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 169 occupations that require
BA degree skills with a combined 20.5 million jobs. The total includes 93
occupations with 10 million jobs that had a median wage increase above the
inflation rate of 2.38 percent from 2002 to 2013. The median increase of the
median wage for the 93 occupations was 2.9 percent. There were 32
occupations with 6.8 million jobs that had a median wage increase less than
the inflation rate. The median increase of the median wage for the 32
occupations was 2.0 percent.

The remaining 44 occupations of the 169 do not have corresponding median
wage data for 2013 because some occupations were defined in broader
categories in 2002. For example, a nurse in 2002 was broken into four
occupations in 2013: Registered Nurse, Nurse Anesthetists, Nurse Midwives,
and Nurse Practitioners. Hence wage data is not reported for both years for 44
occupations that have 3.7 million jobs.

In sum, only three of the hundred colleges reviewed had tuition increases less
than 4 percent a year, while only seven occupations of the 125 with data had
median wage increases as high as four percent, and four of the seven were
management occupations. The combination of tuition and wage changes over
time assures a general decline in the rate of return on a BA degree.

Measuring the Decline

A few calculations help measure the decline. Someone entering the University
of Arizona in 2002 had to pay $2,490 for a year’s tuition. At the time student
loan interest was set at 4.06 percent. Using the 4.06 interest rate the total four-
year investment would be $11,012.82 assuming tuition is paid in the fall and
compounded once a year. [Computations are courtesy of the Excel FV
spreadsheet function. Entries for the $11,012.82 are FV(.0406/1, 4, -$2,409, 0
,1). ]

Someone graduating at age 22 in 2006 has 44 years to work and earn a return
on the investment. If the $11,012.82 was invested in stocks and bonds and
earned a 4.06 percent return over the 44 years it would be $65,525.86. To
have the equivalent $65,525.86 because of a better job requiring college
degree skills, it will be necessary to earn an extra $44.64 a month for the same
44 years. [Excel entries for the $65,525.86 are FV(.0406/12, 528, 0,
-$11,012.82 ,1) and so on.]

Any amount above $44.64 and the return is above 4.06 percent. If the amount
was $100 a month for 44 years the return would be 10.9 percent, a return
higher than most long term stock returns or student loans.

However, compare that to what happens to someone entering the University
of Arizona in 2013 when a year’s tuition jumped to $10,391. In the time
between 2002 and 2013 the interest on college student loans has gyrated from
a low of 3.4 to a high of 6.8 percent, but it was set at 3.86 percent for the
2013-2014 academic year. Using a 3.86 interest rate the total four-year
investment will be $45,732.76, again assuming tuition is paid in the fall and
compounded once a year.

If the $45,732.76 was invested in stocks and bonds and earned a 3.86 percent
return over 44 years, as above, it would be $249,258.16. To have the
equivalent $249,258.16 because of a better job requiring college degree skills,
it will be necessary to earn an extra $179.58 a month for 44 years, a little over
four times $44.64.

Any amount above $179.58 and the return will be greater than 3.86 percent,
but any amount below $179.58 and the return is lower. If the amount was
$100 as it was above the return drops to a paltry .67 percent.

Risk

Rapidly rising tuition during a period of stagnant wages has not slowed the
tied of graduates. The number of working age adults with BA degrees keeps
growing because current graduates are more than double the graduates from
the 1970’s who are reaching retirement age. BA degree graduates total 48.7
million from June 1971 until the end of the academic year in 2012. If the two
years yet to be reported have at least the same number as 2012, as seems
likely, then 52.3 million working age adults have BA degrees. (3)

Some of the 52.3 million with BA degrees went on to get master’s degrees,
doctorates and professional degrees. Subtracting the graduate and professional
degrees from the total still leaves 28.2 million working age adults with BA
degrees to fill the 20.5 million jobs in 2013 that need BA degree skills.

The growing number of people with BA degree skills raises the risk of delay
to find higher wage career employment. Compare what happens with 10 years
of delay. If the tuition was invested in stocks and bonds and earned 3.86

percent for 10 more years it would grow to $67,235.10. If the $67,235.10 was
invested in stocks and bonds and earned a 3.86 percent return over 34 years, it
would also be $249,258.16 as above. To have the equivalent $249,258.16
because of a better job for 34 years, it will be necessary to earn an extra
$295.21 a month, more than six times the $44.64 from above. An additional
$100 a month would be a negative return that would not earn the initial
investment.

The chances remain good that college will pay, but individual decisions matter
more than ever. I can find 65 occupations in the Occupational Employment
Survey requiring no more than high school skills with employment just over
11 million people that have a median wage greater than $50,000. I expect
some of the people in those jobs have college degrees, but it is likely their
tuition money would be earning a higher return in the stock market. Allow me
to repeat, a good financial return for a college education should not be
assumed.

W ith signs pointing to persistent high unemployment and a recovery even weaker than those of the early 

1990s and 2000s, it is becoming common to hear in the media and among some policy makers the claim 
that lingering unemployment is not cyclical but “structural.” In this story, the jobs problem is not a lack of 
demand for workers but rather a mismatch between workers’ skills and employers’ needs. Another version of the skills 
mismatch is also being told about the future: we face an impending skills shortage, particularly a shortfall of college 
graduates, after the economy returns to full employment.
 
 The common aspect of each of these claims about 
structural problems is that education is the solution, the 
only solution. In other words, delivering the appropriate 
education and training to workers becomes the primary if 
not sole policy challenge if we hope to restore full employ-
ment in the short and medium term and if we expect to 
prevent a (further) loss of competitiveness and a further 
rise in wage and income inequality in the longer term.
There are ample reasons to be skeptical of both claims:

suggest—fueling the rise of long-term unemployment 
in this recession. If there has been some transforma-
tion of the workplace leaving millions of workers 
inadequate for the currently available jobs, then it was 
not based on a major educational upscaling of jobs.

The challenge the nation faces as high unemployment 
persists is not better education and training for those 
currently unemployed. The problem is a lack of jobs. 

The huge increase in wage and income inequality 
experienced over the last 30 years is not a reflection of 
a shortfall in the skills and education of the workforce. 
Rather, workers face a wage deficit, not a skills deficit. 
It is hard to find some ever-increasing need for college 
graduates that is going unmet: college graduates have 
not seen their real wage rise in 10 years, and the pay 
gap with high school graduates has not increased in 
that time period. Moreover, even before the recession 
college students and graduates were working as free 
interns, a phenomenon we would not observe if college 
graduates were in such demand. 

In the following I do not present definitive evidence, but I 
hope to be persuasive enough for readers to demand more 
evidence before accepting either of these claims of imme-
diate structural employment problems or long-term skills 
deficits.  The  first  section  draws  heavily  on  recent  work 
on structural unemployment in the current recession (see 
Mishel et al. 2010), and the second draws heavily on the 
wages chapter of the most recent version of The State of 
Working America (Mishel et al. 2009). 

i. is current unemployment  
    primarily structural in nature?

The context
Unemployment  has  remained  at  9.5%  or  above    since 
mid-2009 and may remain that high or inch even higher 
through 2011. The predominant narrative to describe this 
situation has been that the bursting of the housing and 
stock bubbles and the financial crisis led to a severe cut-
back in household consumption and business investment, 
causing  severe  job  losses.  The  policy  conclusion  drawn 

from this narrative is that we need faster growth to increase 
the demand for workers and reduce unemployment.
 
A  competing  and,  in  my  view,  misguided  narrative 
has also been put forth that a large share of current high 
unemployment  is  structural,  meaning  that  those  who 
are unemployed are not well suited to the jobs becoming 
available. This would be, for instance, because their skills 
are  inadequate,  have  deteriorated,  or  are  not  applicable 
to  the  industries  that  are  expanding,  or  because  the  
unemployed simply do not live where the jobs are. Some 
make  claims  about  structural  unemployment  because 
certain  aggregate  relationships,  such  as  that  between  
job openings and unemployment, do not appear to be 
following historical patterns, thereby suggesting a possible 
skills  mismatch.  Others  have  postulated  that  employers 
have substantially revamped their production processes in 
this downturn, thereby eliminating the need for many of 
the types of workers who are currently unemployed. Still 
others note that the housing bubble led to a bloated con-
struction sector, and many of those jobs will never come 
back; displaced construction workers must switch to new 
jobs for which they may not be qualified. The policy im-
plications of a finding that high unemployment is primarily 
structural are that: (1) it would be foolhardy to use further 
demand management (fiscal stimulus, either tax cuts or 
increased spending, or monetary policy) to lower unem-
ployment, and (2) the appropriate policy is to offer educa-
tion and training to the unemployed to help them make a 
transition to new occupations and sectors.
 
Yet there has been little evidence offered to support 
the claim of extensive structural unemployment, and we 
find  that  the  pattern  of  employer  behavior  regarding 
job openings, layoffs, and hires does not lend it much 
credence. This matters quite a bit for guiding policy. 
 
Lest I be accused of critiquing a straw man, note the 
recent statement of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank 
president, Narayana Kocherlakota (2010):

What  does  this  change  in  the  relationship  be-
tween job openings and unemployment connote? 
In a word, mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t 
find  appropriate  workers.  The  workers  want  to 
work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 2

many possible sources of mismatch—geography, 
skills,  demography—and  they  are  probably  all 
at work. Whatever the source, though, it is hard 
to see how the Fed can do much to cure this 
problem. Monetary stimulus has provided con-
ditions so that manufacturing plants want to hire 
new workers. But the Fed does not have a means 
to transform construction workers into manufac-
turing workers. 
  Of course, the key question is: How much 
of the current unemployment rate is really due 
to mismatch, as opposed to conditions that the 
Fed can readily ameliorate? The answer seems to 
be  a  lot.  Most  of  the  existing  unemployment 
represents mismatch that is not readily amenable 
to monetary policy.

The competing explanation, as mentioned above, is the 
one I find most plausible: the economy is operating far 
below  its  potential  output  because  of  a  shortfall  in 
demand caused by an extreme loss of financial and housing 
wealth  that  caused  consumption  to  fall;  thus,  there  are 
simply not enough jobs to go around. Evidence for this 
explanation focuses on such indicators as low operating 
capacity  in  manufacturing,  which  was  71.6%  in  June 
2010, down from 79.1% in December 2007. Vacancies 
in  commercial  offices  (now  at  17.4%)  are  further  indi-
cation of excess capacity. The bottom line is that total 
demand in the second quarter of 2010 was still below its 
pre-recession level. In fact, total output, as measured by 
gross domestic product, was 1.3% below its pre-recession 
level. Of course, one would expect demand and output 
to have grown substantially over the two-and-a-half years 
since the official start of the recession and the ensuing 
recovery. The Congressional Budget Office conservatively 
puts  the  “output  gap,”  the  difference  between  potential 
and actual output, at 6.4% in the second quarter.1 I think 
the output gap is larger, probably about 9.0% (derived by 
multiplying 4.5% excess unemployment by 2, from the 
usual Okun gap formula). 
In my view, the pervasiveness of (1) lost employment 
  
and  output  across  sectors  and  (2)  high  unemployment 
across types of workers by state, education, age, and occupa-
tion suggests an aggregate or macroeconomic explanation 

rather  than  one  rooted  in  a  few  sectors  or  locations  or 
because some workers lack skills. 

skepticism appropriate
The claim that current unemployment is primarily struc-
tural should require much more evidence than has been 
offered because common sense would deny such an expla-
nation. The structural unemployment story presumes that 
millions  of  workers  are  now  inadequately  prepared  for 
available jobs even though they were fruitfully employed 
just a few months or years ago. The argument raises a few 
key questions.

Has there been a major shift in  
productivity or technology investment?
What footprints would lead us to believe that the economy 
transformed itself from the end of 2007 to the beginning 
of 2010, leaving millions of workers inadequate? Produc-
tivity did grow a pretty spectacular 6.3% from early 2009 
to  early  2010,  but  that  was  the  extent  of  productivity 
growth since the recession started in late 2007.2 Net in-
vestment  in  business  equipment  and  software  in  2009 
(the latest data) was actually negative, the first time this 
occurred since World War II.3 Thus, the alleged structural 
transformation  of  production  processes  that  left  4-5% 
of  the  labor  force  inadequate  for  the  available  jobs  was 
clearly not associated with new equipment or new techno-
logical processes (requiring software), leaving us doubtful 
it happened at all.

Have the jobs moved around? 
Is  the  problem  just  a  need  for  greater  mobility,  for  the 
unemployed  to  move  to  where  jobs  are  more  plentiful? 
Well,  where  would  they  go?  There  are  11  states  with  a 
total adult population of about 17 million where the un-
employment rate in June was less than 7.0%.4 There are 
not enough jobs in those states to matter much, and if 
the unemployed moved to those states they would nearly 
double the labor force there. 

Is unemployment unusually high  
compared to job openings?
The “Beveridge curve” describes the historical relationship 
between unemployment and job openings, and allows one 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 3

to predict how high or low the unemployment rate should 
be given a certain number of job openings. There has been 
much attention to the mid-July blog post by David Altig 
(2010a), senior vice president and research director at the 
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, who used such an analysis 
to  suggest  that  almost  a  third  of  the  unemployed,  4.6 
million workers, are structurally unemployed. His claim 
was  based  solely  on  a  simple  analysis  of  job  openings 
and  unemployment  since  2000  that  encompassed  the 
experiences  of  just  two  recessions.  Less  noticed  is  that 
Altig (2010b)  retreated  from  this  claim  just  a  month 
later,  following  an  analysis  by  Cleveland  Federal  Re-
serve  economists  Murat Tasci  and  John  Lindner  (Tasci 
and Lindner 2010). Those authors,  using data back to 
1951, showed that unemployment higher than what the 
Beveridge curve would suggest is not “anomalous”: rather, 
it  happened  in  the  initial  recoveries  following  the  deep 
recessions in the 1970s and 1980s as well. 

looking for evidence 
on the employer side
One of the curious aspects of this developing structural 
unemployment storyline is how hard it is to find any re-
search  tying  this  hypothesis  to  actual  detailed  trends  in 
employment, unemployment, or output data. This section 
explores patterns on the demand side, such as employer 
job openings, layoffs, and hiring, to see if they correspond 
to a structural unemployment story. 

The number of job openings
The job seekers ratio, which is the number of unemployed 
workers per job opening, provides ample evidence of a 
demand  side  problem.  Simply  put,  the  number  of  job 
openings  has  been  far  too  few  to  accommodate  those 
looking for work.
 
As Figure A shows, the ratio of unemployed to job 
openings  surpassed  six  in  the  summer  of  2009  but  has

Months into recovery

dropped to the low five range more recently (once jobs to 
conduct the 2010 Census were filled). Even if the unem-
ployed filled every job opening there would still remain 
many unemployed workers, an indication of too few job 
openings.5 The ratio of the unemployed to job openings 
in recent months has been nearly double that attained at 
the worst points of the early 2000s recession, a ratio of 
2.8, which is not surprising since total job openings in the 
last half of 2009 were 25% below those in mid-2003. 
  We can examine this phenomenon further by com-
paring the cumulative number of job openings in the first 
12 months of the last recovery to the first 12 months of 
this one.
 
Figure B shows that the cumulative job openings in 
this recovery’s first year were about 32.0 million, roughly 
10.0 million fewer than the cumulative openings in the 

early 2000s recovery. Recall that the recovery of the early 
2000s is known as a “jobless recovery,” as the economy 
shed an additional 600,000 jobs after the recession had 
ended. Yet the current recovery has generated far fewer job 
openings than that pitifully weak recovery.
 
Job openings by industrial sector. A shortfall in job 
openings is clear, yet a concentration of this shortfall in a 
few specific industries such as construction would provide 
evidence of a structural shift. 
 
Figure C shows the ratio in each sector of the cumula-
tive job openings in the current recovery to those in the 
early 2000s recovery. This measure shows how far short 
this  recovery’s  job  openings  are  relative  to  those  of  the 
earlier  recovery  for  each  sector. The  shortfall  in  job 
openings  is  pervasive,  occurring  in  every  sector  (except 
mining). Recent openings averaged 72% of those in the

earlier  recovery.  Recent  construction  job  openings  were 
indeed just 58% of those in the earlier recovery, but the 
shortfall in job openings was also severe in labor-intensive 
service industries such as hospitality, entertainment, and 
accommodation. Since the trends are pervasive across all 
sectors, it is time to stop thinking about unemployment 
and the failure to generate job openings as a circumstance 
driven by developments in particular sectors.
 
Table 1, which shows the job opening data for each 
sector in both the 2001 and 2007 recoveries, allows an 
assessment of the scale of the recent openings shortfall by 
sector. Construction is responsible for 5.7% of the recent 
shortfall,  but  that  is  comparable  to  that  sector’s  5.5% 
share  of  employment;  in  other  words,  construction  has 

not played any outsized role in the failure for openings 
to rise as fast now as in the earlier recovery. The shortfall 
has  predominately  been  driven  by  private  service-sector 
industries (professional and business services, health, edu-
cation, entertainment, hospitality, and accommodations), 
which  generated  71%  of  the  openings  shortfall  despite 
having just 46% of total employment. In fact, the worst 
performing industry under this measure was leisure and 
hospitality, which accounts for 10% of employment but 
18% of the job openings shortfall.

The number of job losses
Maybe the issue is that we have been seeing more struc-
tural changes within industries or shifts across industries

that are leading to more layoffs, thereby impeding growth 
in overall employment. A look at the cumulative layoffs 
in this recovery compared to the last recovery, as in 
Figure D, shows that layoffs are not a piece that fills in 
any puzzle: the cumulative layoffs in each recovery are 
totally comparable.

Filling job openings
Last, we examine whether it is harder to fill job openings, 
an  indication  that  structural  challenges  such  as  having 
workers with the right skills or in the right locations are 
evident. The data for the private sector, however, show it 
is easier to hire people now than in the last recovery or 
earlier in this recession, at least as reflected in the ratio of 
hires per job opening.

 
If  it  is  difficult  to  hire  adequately  skilled  workers 
it should take longer to fill vacancies, and the ratio of 
hires to openings should fall. In fact, as Figure E shows, 
the opposite has occurred: the ratio has been somewhat 
higher  in  this  recovery  (averaging  1.7  hires  per  job 
opening) relative to the earlier recovery (1.5 hires per job 
opening).6 Moreover, this ratio has increased since the 
recession started, which means there is no evidence of a 
growing structural problem. Remember, too, how these 
data are timed. “Job openings” is the count of available 
jobs on the last day of the month. “Hires,” on the other 
hand, is the sum of all hires completed throughout the 
month. As long as the number of hires is larger than the 
number of openings, it is taking less than a month to fill 
those jobs.

looking for evidence  
on the employee side
The analysis now turns to an examination of the charac-
teristics of the unemployed, especially the increase in un-
employment, to see whether those who are unemployed 
are  not  well  matched  to  the  available  jobs.  Since  those 
making  the  claim  that  there  is  severe  structural  unem-
ployment have not presented any evidence about workers 
themselves—relying simply on the extent of overall un-
employment—it is difficult to identify how to test their 
claim. However, it seems reasonable to assume that workers 
who are “inadequate” for current jobs would tend to have 
less  education,  be  stuck  in  declining  industries,  and  be 
older. To gauge whether this is the case the analysis that 
follows  focuses  on  how  the  composition  of  unemploy-

ment  and  long-term  unemployment  has  changed  since 
2007. That is, the analysis explores who (which type of 
worker) fueled the rise in unemployment and long-term 
unemployment.
 
The construction industry
Much of the intuitive appeal of the structural unemploy-
ment claim is that the recession came because of the bursting 
of the housing bubble and the consequent shrinking of the 
construction sector. In this view, many unskilled workers 
who benefited from the expansion of the construction 
sector have been forced to find new types of work, pre-
sumably a difficult transition to make. I will not comment 
on the notion that construction workers are “unskilled,” 
which  can  easily  be  refuted  by  an  examination  of  their

wages  and  benefits  and  the  training  needed  for  jobs  in 
this sector: this is plainly a judgment on “skill” set by the 
fact that workers in this sector do not necessarily need to 
have a college education or an advanced degree. Rather 
let us turn to what we know about unemployment in this 
sector. A minor foray into labor market data suggests that 
construction does not play the outsized role imagined by 
the president of the Minnesota Federal Reserve Bank and 
many other commentators. It is true that construction has 
lost nearly two million jobs in this downturn, 25% of all 
private sector jobs lost. But is this what has fueled growing 
unemployment? The answer is no. In the second quarter of 
2010 (Figure F) unemployed construction workers made 
up 12.4 % of the unemployed and 12.5% of the long-term 

unemployed:  this  means  that  unemployed  construction 
workers are not more likely to be long-term unemployed 
than those displaced from other sectors. Even before the 
recession, in 2007, unemployed construction workers were 
10.6%  of  all  unemployed  and  11.0%  of  the  long-term 
unemployed. This means that the composition of unem-
ployment and long-term unemployment has barely shifted 
toward construction workers. Just because there was an ex-
treme loss of jobs in construction does not imply that those 
workers  are  driving  up  unemployment.  More  research  is 
needed to determine what happened to those workers dis-
placed from construction, but it is apparent that many have 
found jobs in other sectors, and perhaps some of the immi-
grant workers in this sector have left the country.

The composition of unemployment
Table 2 provides a breakdown of unemployment by edu-
cation level, based on published BLS data for those ages 
25 and over (this group has presumably completed its 
education). The data are presented for the last quarter of 
the previous recovery to give an indication of the com-
position of unemployment before the recession. Data are 
also  presented  for  the  most  recent  quarter  (the  second 
quarter of 2010) and for that same quarter in 2009. This 
allows us to examine the changes over the entire recession 
and over the last year, a period where the Beveridge curve 
analyses are said to suggest a growing mismatch between 
the  skills  of  the  unemployed  and  those  needed  for  job 
openings. What is most apparent from Table 2, however, 
is that the composition of unemployment has remained 
remarkably stable throughout this period. Workers with 

less education have higher unemployment rates at every 
point in the business cycle, but the unemployment rate 
has more than doubled for every education group over the 
downturn. Unemployment rose for each education group 
in the last year  except the least-educated—those lacking 
a high school degree—a finding not very supportive of a 
recent twist against the least-educated workers.
  The second panel presents the composition of unem-
ployment by education level, and the trends do not support 
any notion of this recession’s higher unemployment being 
fueled by those with the least education. The share of the 
unemployed with bachelor’s degrees or more is the same 
in the most recent quarter as before the recession. Those 
with some college have seen their share of unemployment 
bumped  up  slightly. These  two  groups  make  up  the 
upper  61% of the labor force by education, and their

share of unemployment has not fallen. One might even 
imagine  that  our  expectation  is  that  those  with  more 
education saw their share decline in a recession. Further 
analysis  along  these  lines,  looking  at  earlier  recessions, 
would be useful.
 
Table 3 provides data on the rise in the unemployment 
rates by demographic group, including by education, for 
those ages 16 and over. The table also provides information 
on the long-term unemployment of each group: the share 
of the labor force that is long-term unemployed (27 weeks 
or more) and the share of the unemployed of each group 
that is unemployed long term. Data are presented for two 
time periods, the last half of both 2007 and 2009. These 
data are computed from the microdata and therefore are 
not seasonally adjusted, and so we make comparisons to 
similar time periods of the year.
 
Between  these  two  periods  the  unemployment  rate 
more  than  doubled,  up  4.9  percentage  points  to  9.5%. 
As  we  saw  in  the  previous  table,  unemployment  rose 

sharply  for  every  education  group.  With  these  data 
we can separately examine those with a bachelor’s degree 
and those with advanced degrees and see that those with 
at  most  a  college  degrees  saw  their  unemployment  rate 
rise (up 119%) as fast as or faster than those with a high 
school degree or less. It does appear that older workers saw 
their unemployment rate rise disproportionately relative 
to younger workers (those ages 16 to 24), consistent with 
possible structural unemployment. Along these same lines 
it is true that the oldest workers had the highest share of 
long-term unemployed among the unemployed of their 
group (45.9%). 
  The  biggest  strike  against  the  structural  unemploy-
ment  claim  is  that  every  education  group  has  a  similar 
share  of  its  unemployment  as  long-term  unemployed. 
Therefore, it seems that all workers once they are unem-
ployed have a similar probability of being unemployed for 
at least 27 weeks regardless of their education level. That 
means that there is no particular education skew fueling

the rise of long-term unemployment, just as we saw with 
overall  unemployment  in  the  previous  table.  If  there 
has  been some transformation of the workplace leaving 
millions of workers inadequate for the currently available 
jobs, as the structural unemployment claim would venture, 
then  this  transformation  was  definitely  not  based  on 
a major educational upscaling of jobs, or at least that is 
what the unemployment data are telling us. 
 
It is also clear that black workers suffer by far the most 
from long-term unemployment, with 6.7% of the black 
labor force affected. Blacks have an even larger share of 

the long-term unemployed than the whole group of those 
lacking a high school degree, even though the vast majority 
of the black labor force has a high school degree or further 
education. This finding, however, sheds no particular in-
sight into the structural unemployment claim.

Conclusion on current  
structural unemployment
We increasingly hear or read claims that we have a serious 
structural unemployment problem, even to the extent of 
claiming that most of the unemployed beyond a normal

 ●   PagE 12

(full-employment) rate face structural problems in finding 
work. This argument implies that unemployment diffi-
culties reside in the workers who are unemployed: they 
either are located in the wrong place or do not have the 
required  skills  for  the  currently  available  jobs.  If  this 
is  so,  then  macroeconomic  tools  such  as  fiscal  policy 
(spending or tax cuts) or monetary policy cannot address 
our unemployment or long-term unemployment situa-
tion.  But  surprisingly,  perhaps  amazingly,  there  is  no 
systematic empirical evidence for such assertions. Before 
policy  makers  adopt  this  framework—that  much  of 
our unemployment is “structural”—they should require 
much more evidence than is currently available. This is 
especially the case because common sense would suggest 
that the problem faced by the unemployed is a scarcity 
of  job  openings,  a  feature  of  the  labor  market  facing 
every group of workers regardless of education, sector, 
occupation, and location.

ii. is there a looming shortage of  
      college-educated workers?
The second structural issue to examine in the labor market 
is the claim that the economy faces a looming shortage of 
college graduates that, if not addressed, will cause flagging 
competitiveness and further growth in wage and income 
inequality. A related claim is that the rise in wage inequality 
over the last 30 years or so can be traced primarily to a 
technology-driven shift toward a greater need for “more 
educated” and skilled workers—i.e., college graduates—
that  was  not  met  by  a  corresponding  increase  in  the 
supply of college graduates. This is not necessarily a short-
age we face in the next few years, according to some leading 
economists,  but  one  we  will  face  when  the  economy 
returns to full employment. 
 
In response to a question posed by The Economist, “Is 
America facing an increase in structural unemployment?” 
MIT economist Daron Acemoglu wrote an article, “Yes, 
the labour force hasn’t responded to shifting demand for 
skills” (Acemoglu 2010). He wrote:

US structural unemployment is up. But this is 
not a recent turn of events. It is the continua-
tion  of  an  ongoing  process….US  employment 
and  demand  for  labour  have  been  undergoing 

profound changes over the last 30 years. While 
the  demand  for  high  skill  workers,  who  can 
perform  complex,  often  non-production  tasks, 
has  increased,  manufacturing  jobs  and  other 
“middling  occupations”  have  been  in  decline. 
Also noteworthy is that over the last 10-15 years, 
many relatively low-skill, low-pay service occupa-
tions have been expanding rapidly.

David  Autor  (2010),  another  MIT  economist  and  a 
co-author  with  Acemoglu  of  important  papers  on  this 
topic, recently wrote a paper for the Hamilton Project 
and the Center for American Progress saying:

Although the U.S. labor market will almost surely 
rebound  from  the  Great  Recession,  this  paper 
presents  a  somewhat  disheartening  picture  of 
its  longer-term  evolution.  Rising  demand  for 
highly educated workers, combined with lagging 
supply, is contributing to higher levels of earnings 
inequality.  Demand  for  middle-skill  jobs  is 
declining,  and  consequently,  workers  that  do 
not obtain postsecondary education face a con-
tracting set of job opportunities.

The  policy  implications  of  this  impending  skills  short-
age, according to Autor, are that “an increased supply of  
college graduates should eventually help to drive down the 
college wage premium and limit the rise in inequality,” and 
“the United States should foster improvements in K-12 
education so that more people will be prepared to go on to 
higher education.” Moreover, we need “training programs 
to boost skill levels and earnings opportunities in histori-
cally low-skilled service jobs—and more broadly, to offer 
programs  for  supporting  continual  learning,  retraining, 
and mobility for all workers.” In short, the U.S. needs 
to  create  many  more  college  graduates  and  to  provide 
various  types  of  training  for  those  who  do  not  become 
college graduates.
 
But the need to vastly boost the total number of college 
graduates in the future may not be as great as Autor and 
Acemoglu believe. For instance, the trends in the 2000s 
indicate that the relative demand for college graduates is 
growing much more slowly than in prior decades. Plus,

the wages for college graduates have been flat for about 
10 years and running parallel to those with high school 
degrees, and they have been growing far more slowly than 
productivity. The implication of these trends is that a surge 
of college graduates, whatever the benefits (and there are 
many), can be expected to drive the college wage down. 
Wage inequality would diminish, but by pressing college 
graduate wages down (not just in relative terms), which is 
not the picture frequently painted of the future.
 
It is important to note that when we discuss the em-
ployment or wages of “college graduates” we refer to those 
with a four-year degree but no further degree; i.e., we ex-
clude both those with advanced or “professional” degrees and 
those with associate college degrees or with “some college” 
but no degree past high school. This definition is important 
because  the  trends  for  the  aggregate  group  of  all  those 
with  a  college  degree,  including  those  with  advanced 
degrees, is always far more favorable than trends among 
those with at most a bachelor’s degree. For instance, in 

2009 the unemployment rate among all college graduates 
was 4.6%, but those with at most a bachelor’s degree had 
a rate of 5.2% and those with advanced degrees had a rate 
of 3.4%. There are also very different wage trends among 
those with only bachelor’s degrees (not so good) and those 
with advanced degrees (much better). And so it is not sur-
prising that analyses which look at the aggregate college 
group would recommend a vast increase in the supply of 
college graduates, but in reality what the trends mean is 
that we need more people with advanced degrees, not just 
college degrees. It is important to distinguish these groups 
so we are clear about the findings and implications.
 
Remarkably, few people seem to know how the work-
force breaks down across these categories, and so we have 
illustrated them in Table 4. Note that about 21% of those 
employed have at most a bachelor’s degree, and another 
10% have an advanced degree. Only 6.1% of non-immi-
grant employed workers lack a high school degree (or do 
not have a GED). A small group, roughly 10%, have an

associate’s college degree, but an even larger group, about 
20%,  has  attended  college  but  has  no  degree  past  high 
school; this group is labeled “some college.”
 
As  we  have  argued  in  great  detail  in  The  State  of 
Working America (Mishel et al. 2009) and in other studies 
dating back to 1994 (with my frequent co-author, Jared 
Bernstein) technological change and unmet needs for skill 
have had little to do with the growth of wage inequality 
over the last 30 years. This is not to say that there hasn’t 
been  an  increased  employer  demand  for  workers  with 
more skills and more education: that has been happening 
for at least a century. What this means is that the growing 
need for “education” has been met with a growing supply. 
For  instance,  between  1973  and  2007  the  share  of  the 
workforce with bachelor’s degrees and advanced degrees 
has  doubled,  from  about  10%  of  the  workforce  with  a 
bachelor’s degree and 4.5% with an advanced degree.
Regardless of the pressures or lack of them from the 
 
labor  market,  it  would  be  a  very  positive  thing  to  give 
every student who wants to obtain a college education a 
real chance—resources and the appropriate education in 
K-12—to attend and complete college, even if this drives 
down the college wage. One could argue that the issue 
facing the nation is not so much the need to vastly increase 
the number of college graduates but to give broader 
access to the asset of a completed college education. While 
employer demand is not booming so much that we need 
to vastly boost college graduation—it will continue to 
expand at a rate fast enough to satisfy employer needs—
it  may  be  the  case  that  moving  forward  we  will  have  a 
challenge to generate enough college graduates because we 
will be exhausting the traditional sources of their supply, 
the white middle  and upper classes. (That is an avenue of 
research the author expects to pursue.)
 
Furthermore, it is still certainly the case that com-
pleting college will put a person in a better position in 
the workplace relative to someone who has less education, 
at  least  on  average.  And  there  are  clear  non-economic 
benefits as well, from enjoying better health to being a 
more  informed  citizen.  Going  to  college  will  not  be  a 
guarantee of a certain type of income or even access to 
certain employer benefits—recent college graduates (not 
just during the recession) earn less in their mid-twenties 
than those who graduated in the late 1990s, and they 

are far less likely to have jobs with employer-provided 
health insurance (Mishel et al. 2009)—yet recent college 
graduates are clearly faring better than those who have 
attained only a high school degree. 
 
Wage inequality:  
It is about much more than college
Though this paper does not attempt to break down the 
rise of wage inequality into its various components or 
to analyze the various causes of rising wage inequality, 
we  would  like  to  offer  a  few  findings  that  suggest  that 
the  movement  of  the  college  wage  premium—the  gap 
between college and high school wages—is not central 
to the growth of wage inequality over time.

What is going on at the top
One of the remarkable aspects of the growth of wage and 
income  inequality  over  the  last  three  decades  is  the 
immense  growth  at  the  very  top  of  these  distributions 
relative  to  every  other  group.  This  trend  has  not  been 
explored  frequently  with  the  wage  distribution  because 
the main sources of data do not allow one to separate out 
the top 1%. However, research using Social Security wage 
data that we have been able to update does permit an 
assessment of wage growth at the very top. Consider the 
two illustrations in Figure G. The first shows that annual 
wages for the top 0.1% grew 324% from 1979 to 2006, 
20 times faster than the 16% wage growth of the bottom 
90%  of  wage  earners.  The  top  1%,  which  includes  the 
top 0.1%, had 144% growth in annual wages. The next 
rung down, those in the 95-99th percentile of wages, saw 
wage growth of 52%, at least three times faster than wage 
growth of the bottom 90% but nowhere near the growth 
of the top 1%. 
 
The second part of Figure G demonstrates the dif-
ferences another way, detailing the ratio of the wages 
of the top 0.1% and the top 1% to the wages of the 
bottom 90%.
  What happened at the top is not a trivial matter, as 
the top 1%’s share of all wages almost doubled from 7.3% 
to  13.6%  over  this  period,  nearly  corresponding  to  the 
wage share loss of the bottom 90% (an 8.3 percentage-
point decline in wage share). Thus, what the bottom 90% 
lost essentially accrued to the very top.

The stories usually told about changing production tech-
niques and technological change and patterns of demand 
for  skills  have  little  to  do  with  this  critically  important 
dimension of the growth of wage inequality.

The productivity–pay gap 
During  the  postwar  period  into  the  1970s  productivity 
and pay (compensation or wages per hour) grew in tandem, 
but starting in the late 1970s productivity growth began 
to far outpace the growth of pay. Between 1979 and 2007 
productivity in the nonfarm business sector grew by 73%, 
while the hourly compensation of production, nonsuper-
visory workers (over 80% of all employment) rose by about 
4%, with all of that growth occurring in the boom period 
of the late 1990s. If anything, the divergence between 
pay and productivity has widened in recent years, with the 

divergence stronger in the last recovery than in any prior 
recovery back into the 1970s. 
 
Figure H shows the gap between the growth of pro-
ductivity  and  that  of  the  hourly  compensation  of  the 
median  college-  and  high-school-educated  worker  since 
1995. Each variable is indexed to 1995, so the lines show 
growth relative to their 1995 value. Hourly compensation 
grew in the late 1990s for each type of worker, though 
not  at  the  rate  at  which  productivity  improved.  After 
the momentum of the wage growth in the 1990s boom 
faded in the 2002-03 period, there was no growth in pay, 
though productivity continued to climb (it actually grew 
somewhat faster than in the late 1990s).
This gap between productivity and pay growth is a fun-
damental characteristic of the economy, and a key policy 
challenge is how to reconnect productivity and pay growth.

It is hard to see how we can have rising consumption 
not based on asset bubbles or household debt unless we 
succeed in restoring wage growth as productivity rises.
That is not our focus here, however. The point for our cur-
rent purposes is that the pay of college graduates is as dis-
connected from productivity growth as is the pay of high 
school graduates. Vastly expanding college enrollment and 
completion will do nothing to address this problem.

Education wage gaps are 
 just a part of wage inequality
Many media and other discussions of the need for more 
people to complete college focus on the growth of the 
college  wage  premium,  that  is,  the  degree  to  which 
college graduates earn more than high school graduates. 
It is frequently assumed, as in the discussion by Autor 
and  Acemoglu  above,  that  the  rising  college  premium 
accounts  for  the  growth  of  overall  wage  inequality. 
In fact, that is not the case. Most of the growth of wage 
inequality—the wage gap between a high-wage and low-
wage worker—can be explained by increased wage gaps 
among  workers  with  the  same  education  (e.g.,  the  in-
equality of wages among college graduates) than by wage 
gaps  between  workers  of  different  educations  (e.g.,  the 
college wage premium). That being the case, then even if 
greater college enrollment and completion could eliminate 
the wage gap between college graduates and other workers, 
much of wage inequality (and the greater extent of wage 
inequality  now  versus  the  past)  would  still  remain,  and 
wage inequality would continue to grow.
In more technical language, there are two dimensions 
 
of wage inequality—”between-group” wage differentials, 
such  as  those  relating  to  groups  defined  by  their  edu-
cation and experience, and “within-group” wage inequality 
that  occurs  among  workers  of  similar  education  and 
experience. The growth of within-group inequality can 
account for roughly 60% of the growth of overall wage 
inequality  since  1973  (see  Table  3.21  of  The  State  of 
Working  America; Mishel et al. 2009). The connection 
between growing wage gaps among workers with similar 
education and experience is not easily related to techno-
logical change unless interpreted as a reflection of growing 
economic returns to worker skills (motivation, aptitudes 
for math, etc.) that are not easily measured (that is, the 

regressions used to estimate education differentials can-
not estimate these kinds of differentials). However, there 
are no signs that the growth of within-group wage in-
equality  has  been  fastest  in  those  industries  where  the 
use of technology grew the most. It is also unclear why 
the economic returns for measurable skills (e.g., educa-
tion)  and  unmeasured  skills  (e.g.,  motivation)  should 
not grow in tandem. In fact, between-group and within-
group inequality have not moved together in the various 
sub-periods since 1973.
  The timing of the growth of within-group wage in-
equality  does  not  easily  correspond  to  the  technology 
story.  For instance,  consider what  happened  during the 
1995-2000  period  associated  with  a  technology-led 
productivity boom: within-group wage inequality actually 
declined  among  women  and  was  essentially  flat  among 
men.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  so-called  early  stages  of 
the “new economy,” within-group wage inequality grew 
moderately,  whereas  it  grew  rapidly  in  the  low-produc-
tivity 1980s. Within-group wage inequality did, however, 
start  growing  again  as  productivity  accelerated  further 
after  2000  but  still  lags  far  behind  the  1980s  pace.  All 
in  all,  changes  in  within-group  wage  inequality  do  not 
seem to mirror the periods of rapid productivity growth 
or  technological  change.  Perhaps  more  important,  the 
extent of within-group wage inequality is not affected at 
all by the supply-side education and training policies that 
are usually linked to a claim about a shortage of college 
graduates—so there is no reason to believe that vastly in-
creasing college enrollment and completion will diminish 
within-group wage inequality.
  The growth of inequalities among college graduates 
has  an  important  practical  interpretation  as  well.  As 
Richard Freeman of Harvard University has pointed out, 
the  wider  variance  of  earnings  among  college  graduates 
implies  that  obtaining  a  college  degree  is  becoming  a 
riskier investment.

Wage inequality in the 2000s
It is surprising that the story of the education premium 
driving wage inequality persists in the face of its complete 
failure to explain wage inequality in the 2000s. Most dis-
cussions, like those referred to above, make it seems as if 
the trends of the 1980s were a juggernaut that continued 

EPi  BriEfing P aPEr #286   ●   january 00, 2011 

 ●   PagE 18

unabated throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, the 
demand for college graduates relative to other workers has 
grown the least in this decade compared to other post-
war decades, and the college premium, which has grown 
substantially since the late 1970s, has not grown much at 
all in recent years. Finally, the actual real wage of college 
graduates has not grown in about 10 years. Along these 
lines it is noteworthy that the jobs obtained by young 
college graduates in recent years pay less than the jobs 
obtained  by  those  graduating  five  and  10  years  earlier, 
both in terms of their wages and in the probability that 
employers provide health insurance or pension coverage.
 
Together, these trends suggest that the forthcoming 
supply of college graduates is meeting the growing demands 
of  employers  for  such  workers.  Moreover,  these  trends 
suggest  that  a  rapid  expansion  of  the  supply  of  college 
graduates will cause the wages of college graduates to de-
cline, assuming that the productivity–pay gap continues 
unabated.  We  can  expect  the  wages  of  young  college 

graduates  and  male  college  graduates  (whose  wages  are 
currently in decline) to experience the steepest declines. 
That  may  or  may  not  be  a  desirable  outcome,  but  it  is 
definitely not the outcome that most people would expect 
given the claims that graduating many more people from 
college will prevent a rise of inequality or reduce inequality.

A relatively flat line  
cannot explain a rising line
Table 5 presents two wage ratios, one describing the dif-
ference between high-wage and middle-wage workers (the 
logged wage ratio of the 95th percentile to the median) 
and  the  other  the  difference  between  the  wages  earned 
by  college  graduates  and  high  school  graduates  (called 
the  college–high  school  wage  premium).  The  data  in 
Table 5 show the changes in the last three business cycles 
(1979-89, 1989-2000, and 2000-07) in terms of both the 
total change and the annual change (which allows for a 
better comparison of periods of different length).

In the 1980s the trends in overall wage inequality at 
the top half of the wage distribution—illustrated by the 
95/50 wage ratio—correspond closely to the growth of the 
college wage premium. In the 1990s business cycle both 
wages continued to rise, though at a somewhat slower 
pace. More significant for our discussion, though, is that 
the college premium in the 1990s no longer was rising 
as fast or faster than the 95/50 wage ratio: rather, the 
college premium rose about 70% as fast. This divergence 
became  even  stronger  in  the  2000s,  when  the  college 
wage premium rose hardly at all (up 0.003 log points per 
year for men) and the 95/50 wage ratio continued to grow 
strongly among men (the same 0.01 log point pace as in 
the  1990s)  and  among  women  (though  at  a  somewhat 
slower pace than in the 1990s). It is hard to explain how 
a  trend  that  became  relatively  flat—the  growth  of  the 
college wage premium—is said to be driving fast-growing 
wage inequality. 

The relative demand for  
college graduates slows down
Table 6 presents estimates of changes in the relative wages, 
relative supply, and relative demand for college graduates 
(those with a four-year degree or more and some of those 
with an education beyond high school) for periods covering 
the last 90 years (from the work of Claudia Goldin and 
Lawrence  Katz).  These  measures  show  whether  college 
graduates  are  becoming  better  paid  and  more  plentiful  
relative  to  those  without  a  college  degree.  Using  an 
assumed value for the elasticity of substitution (i.e., how 
easy it is to replace a college worker with one who does 
not  have  a  college  degree  in  the  process  of  producing 
goods and services) one can calculate, as this table does, 
trends in relative demand for college graduates. In effect, 
the  more  the  relative  supply  or  the  relative  wage  of 
college graduates increases, the more the relative demand 
for college graduates must have risen (or else the increased

relative  supply  would  have  led  to  lower  relative  wages). 
Because these measures include those with an advanced 
degree  beyond  college  along  with  those  with  at  most  a 
bachelor’s degree, they overstate, in my view, the growth 
of the relative demand and wages of those with a bachelor’s 
degree (although one cannot be sure, since some workers 
with  less  than  a  college  degree  are  also  included).  For 
purposes of this discussion we will refer to this group as 
college graduates.
  What does the pattern in Table 6 tell us? First, the 
relative demand for college graduates grew over the entire 
period (except during the special circumstances of World 
War II, when wages grew faster for non-college workers), 
and an expanding relative supply of college graduates 
occurred throughout this period. In this light we can safely 
say  that  employers  have  demonstrated  an  increasingly 
greater need for college graduates over this entire period.
The data in Table 6 are also informative about the last few 
decades. In the 1970s the wages of college graduates de-
clined relative to other workers in response to a rapid growth 
in the supply of college graduates that overwhelmed the 
growing need for them. But their relative wages rapidly 
recovered and grew in the 1980s. It is this growth of the 
college  wage  at  a  time  of  rapid  growth  in  overall  wage 
inequality that has focused attention on education/wage 
gaps and led to technological change as an explanation. 
 
It  is  critical  to  note,  however,  that  the  trends  since 
1990, especially in the 2000s, do not fit an explanation 
of a technologically driven demand for college-educated 
workers driving up their wages and therefore driving up 
wage inequality. Note that the relative demand for college 
graduates grew more slowly in the 1990s than in any pre-
vious period since World War II, and that relative demand 
grew even more slowly in the 2000-05 period than in the 
1990s. That is, the rapid growth of the need for college 
graduates is not a juggernaut launched in the early 1980s 
that continues to this day: rather, the relative demand for 
college graduates has been slowing down in each decade 
since the 1980s and is now growing at a historically slow pace. 
It is this slow pace of the most recent period that might be 
the best clue to the future needs for college graduates.
  This change in trend would suggest that the argument 
that we are in a time of historically rapid change in the 
need for education/skills in the workplace is not accurate, 

at least if one equates a college degree with skills. In fact, 
during the entire period since 1980 the relative demand 
for college graduates grew no faster than during the prior 
30 years. So, given that wage inequality grew faster in 
recent decades than in earlier decades when technologi-
cally driven demands for college graduates were at least as 
rapid, it is difficult to say that a more rapid rise in tech-
nological change drove up wage inequality in recent years. 
That is, there was not an acceleration of a technologically 
driven demand for college graduates that can explain why 
wage inequality rose in the last three decades but did not 
in the prior three decades.
  The  fact  that  skill-biased  technological  change  has 
not been more rapid in recent years, as evidenced by the 
measured growth in relative demand for college graduates, 
is even clearer when one digs a bit deeper into the mea-
sures used in Table 6. The measure of relative demand, 
as explained earlier, is deduced from changes in relative 
supply and the growth in relative wages. It is more accu-
rate to say that this measure of relative demand captures 
all  non-supply  factors  that  influence  relative  wages,  in-
cluding all institutional changes (minimum wage, union-
ization, norms, etc.) and all changes in relative demand 
(arising from technological change but also globalization, 
shifts in consumer demand toward services, and so on). In 
this light, technical change is just one component driving 
the measured “relative demand” for college graduates pre-
sented in Table 6. Given that other factors have been more 
important in the last few decades, including institutional 
ones,  such  as  the  lowering  of  the  minimum  wage  and 
deunionization (which raise the relative wage of college 
graduates by lowering the wages of those without a college 
degree), and globalization, it seems certain that technical 
change was playing a smaller role in the last few decades 
than in the pre-1980 period.
 
Last,  note  that  the  growth  of  the  college  wage 
premium in the 2000-05 period was the slowest of any 
period, other than when the premium actually declined 
in  the  1970s  (due  to  the  rapid  expansion  of  college 
graduates) and during World War II. This measure, how-
ever, includes those with advanced degrees beyond college 
(and some who have less than a four-year college degree), 
so it may actually be overstating the growth in the college 
premium in recent years.

The wage growth of  
college graduates in the 2000s
We have already seen in Figure H that the real hourly com-
pensation  (wages  and  benefits)  of  both  college  graduates 
and high school graduates failed to grow in the recovery of 
the prior business cycle. Figure I shows the trends of the 
median weekly earnings of college graduates (those with just 
a bachelor’s degree) and high school graduates since 2000. 
These data are drawn from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
wage series for those ages 25 and over. As the data show, 
the median college graduate was earning the same weekly 
pay in 2009 as in 2000. This stagnation of wages for college 
graduates preceded the current Great Recession. 
  The wage trends are even more disappointing when 
one examines recent college graduates, a group one might 
imagine includes the best technologically prepared group 

of college graduates. In updating State of Working America 
analyses  we  have  found  that  young  college  graduates 
(defined as those ages 23-29) were earning lower wages 
than those who graduated ahead of them. For instance, 
between  2000  and  2007  the  wages  of  young  college 
graduates fell 2.5% among men and 1.6% among women. 
The wages fell a bit more during the recession years from 
2007 to 2009.
  Health  insurance  coverage  has  fallen  among  young 
college graduates in recent years, from 70.6% covered in 
2000 to 65.7% in 2007. Pension coverage among young 
college graduates fell from 54.6% in 2000 to 46.6% in 
2007. This sharp reduction in both health and pension 
benefits for young college graduates over the last few years 
indicates a substantial job quality problem even for those 
with the highest educational attainment.

 ●   PagE 22

It  is  also  noteworthy  that  weekly  wages  have  fallen 
 
about $40 for the median male full-time college graduate 
between the first half of 2000 and the comparable period 
in 2010. 

Will a large expansion of college graduates 
lead to reduced wages and benefits?
The  most  recent  trends,  those  in  the  prior  business 
cycle  plus  those  in  the  current  downturn,  indicate  that 
the demand for college graduates is growing at a histori-
cally slow rate and that the wages of college graduates have 
been stagnant. The earlier discussion of structural unem-
ployment in the recession showed that unemployment has 
affected college graduates a great deal and that the college 
graduate  share  of  unemployment  and  long-term  unem-
ployment has remained at pre-recession levels. These data 
provide some confirmation that the recession is not intro-
ducing a major shift favorable to college graduates. In this 
environment we have seen that the wages and benefits of 
young college graduates have deteriorated relative to those 
of their older siblings who graduated ahead of them. My 
conjecture would be that these demand conditions can be 
expected to prevail in the future and that any major expan-
sion of the supply of college graduates (beyond the pace of 
expansion in recent years) would necessarily lead to steady 
decline in college wages and benefits, with the wages and 
benefits  of  recent  college  graduates  and  male  college 
graduates suffering the most. This would definitely lead 
to less wage inequality, as the wage gap between college 
and high school graduates would shrink. This, however, is 
hardly anyone’s favored recipe for shared prosperity.
 
It would be useful to work through all the expected 
employment  shifts  to  determine  whether  there  are  any 
trends that might lead to a surge in the need for college 
graduates,  though  none  come  to  mind.  Some  trends 
suggest  a  potential  slowing  of  the  growing  demand  for 
college graduates, such as an expected shrinkage of the 
financial sector and pressure on the federal and state and 
local  governments  to  curtail  employment  as  spending 
grows  more  slowly. We  know  that  there  is  a  surge  in 
college enrollment induced by the recession  that may 
already be providing a major boost to their supply. If so 
we  may  have  more  supply  and  less  demand  for  college 
graduates than recent modeling would show.

The future
Finally, let us look at the pay levels and education and skill 
requirements of the jobs that are projected by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics to be created over the next 10 years. 
These projections do not take account of the trends noted 
just above. Some analysts examine which occupations are 
expected to grow at the fastest (and slowest) rates, while 
others examine which occupations will create the most (or 
least)  absolute  number  of  jobs.  Our  purpose  here  is  to 
assess whether the types of jobs that are expected to be 
created will significantly change the wages that workers 
earn or significantly raise the quality of work or the skill/
education  requirements  needed  to  fill  tomorrow’s  jobs. 
This exercise requires an analysis of how the composition 
of jobs will change, i.e., which occupations will expand or 
contract their share of overall employment.
 
Table 7 presents such an analysis for the 754 occupa-
tions  for  which  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  provides 
projections from 2006 to 2016 (there is a later BLS  pro-
jection than this one, though I doubt it will show different 
results). Through a shift-share analysis (weighting each 
occupation’s characteristic, such as wage level, by its share 
of total employment) we can see what the characteristics 
of jobs are in 2006 and what they will be in 2016 if the 
projections are realized.
  There  are  a  few  drawbacks  to  this  analysis.  One 
is that it does not take into account how the jobs of a 
particular occupation (one of the 754 we analyze) will 
change over the next 10 years. (For example, will em-
ployers’  education  requirements  for  a  loan  officer  or  a 
parking lot attendant grow?) In other words, the changing 
“content” of particular jobs is a dimension of future skill 
requirements not captured by our analysis. Second, we 
have no point of historical comparison (due to lack of 
data availability owing to changing occupational defini-
tions) for judging whether growth expected in the future 
is fast or slow relative to the past. 
  There are some strengths of the analysis, too. We are 
able to look at the education and skill requirements of 
occupations in two ways. One is to look at the educational 
attainment in each occupation now and assume that such 
education levels will prevail in the future. The second is 
to use the education and skill requirements that the BLS 
assigns to each occupation. So, we have one measure that

reflects the workers that employers currently hire into 
each occupation (the “revealed preference” of employers) 
and  another  measure  that  draws  on  BLS’  judgment. 
There  is  still  much  to  learn  from  how  occupational 
composition shifts will affect the job and wage struc-
ture, especially whether the claim that there will be a 
jump  in  the  need  for  college  graduates  is  consistent 
with these projections.
 
Table 7 shows that employment will shift to occupa-
tions with higher median annual wages, but the effect 
will be to raise annual wages by 1.1% over 10 years (or 
about 0.1% per year). This is not a large change compared 
to the real wage growth that normally occurs each year or 

to the composition effects evaluated in earlier years (using 
a different occupation coding system). The analysis also 
shows that the jobs of the future will require greater edu-
cation credentials but not to any great extent. In 2006, 
according to these data, the occupational composition of 
jobs requires that 27.7% of the workforce have a college 
degree or more. This share will rise by one percentage 
point to 28.7% by 2016. The jobs will entail no need 
to  expand  the  share  of  the  workforce  with  only  some 
college,  a  group  roughly  the  same  size  as  the  required 
college-educated  workforce.  The  demand  for  workers 
with a high school degree or less will fall slightly, from 
43.6% to 42.6% over the 2006-16 period.

Table 7 also provides a detailed assessment of the edu-
 
cation or training needed to be employed in an occupa-
tion. The results suggest a shift to the occupations that 
require the most education or training (those requiring a 
bachelor’s degree or more increase their employment share 
by less than a percentage point) and, correspondingly, a 
shift from those occupations that require the least educa-
tion and training (the bottom three categories lose a 1.1 
percentage-point share of employment). Nevertheless, this 
method of gauging occupational skill requirements yields 
a lower estimate of the share of jobs requiring a college 
degree or more, just 21.4% in 2016; the other method, 
based  on  actual  education  in  those  occupations  today, 
suggests a higher 28.7% of college graduates needed. So, 
using assessments of skill requirements in each occupation 
suggests a somewhat smaller growth in skill requirements 
and growth to a lesser level in 2016.
  These projections show that occupational upgrading 
will continue in the future, as the jobs created will be in 
occupations with somewhat higher wages and educational 
and  training  requirements.  This  trend  has  been  evident 
over the last century, and the developments in the future 
do not appear to be extraordinary in any sense. The need 
to greatly expand the size of the college-educated work-
force cannot be demonstrated by looking at occupational 
projections. If future workers will need much more edu-
cation than those currently working, it will only occur 
if  the  education  requirements  in  particular  occupations 
rise substantially.

Conclusion on the looming shortage 
of the college educated
More  education  and  training  is  necessary  to  obtain  the 
long-term growth we desire and to provide equal access to 
job opportunities for the entire population and workforce. 
This was the case 30 years ago and remains the case today. 
Individuals deciding whether to pursue more education 
and  training  would  be  wise  to  enhance  their  human 
capital, as it will place them in a better position as wage 
earners and as citizens.
  That being said, the challenge we face with high and 
persistent  unemployment  exceeding  9%  is  not  better 
education and training for those currently unemployed. 
Rather, we need more jobs. Moreover, the reason we have 

seen a huge increase in wage and income inequality over 
the last 30 years is not a shortfall in the skills and educa-
tion of the workforce. Workers face a “wage deficit” much 
more than a “skills deficit.” 
  Moving forward, our primary challenge is not gener-
ating a greatly expanded supply of college graduates 
because  otherwise  employers  will  not  have  a  sufficient 
number  available  to  them.  Rather,  we  need  to  provide 
access to further education (i.e., college completion) for 
the  many  working  class  and  minority  children  who  are 
now  excluded  from  it  so  they  can  have  a  full  oppor-
tunity to compete for the jobs that require such an edu-
cation.  Greatly  expanding  the  pool  of  college  graduates 
may help to lessen wage and income inequalities, but it 
will do so by forcing young college graduates to take jobs 
with lower pay and benefits than earlier cohorts and by 
pushing downward the average college graduate’s earnings 
(especially  those  of  men).  Those  with  advanced  degrees 
will continue to see their salaries rise, but that group is 
only about a tenth of the workforce and even with rapid 
expansion its share will only rise slowly.  
  The  challenge,  in  my  view,  is  to  provide  a  much 
broader path to prosperity, one that encompasses those 
at  every  education  level.  The  nation’s  productivity  has 
grown  a  great  deal  in  the  last  30  years,  up  80%  from 
1979 to 2009, and such productivity growth or better 
can be expected in the future. Yet with all the income 
generated in the past and expected in the future it is dif-
ficult to explain why more people have not seen rapid 
income growth. It is not the economy that has limited or 
will limit strong income growth, but rather the economic 
policies pursued and the distribution of economic and 
political power that are the limiting factors.

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987:  SUPPLY  AND 

DEMAND  FACTORS* 

LAWRENCE F.  KATZ  AND  KEVIN  M.  MURPHY 

A simple  supply  and demand  framework  is used  to analyze  changes  in the  U.  S. 
wage  structure  from  1963  to  1987.  Rapid  secular  growth  in  the  demand  for 
more-educated  workers,  ""more-skilled""  workers,  and  females  appears  to  be  the 
driving  force behind  observed  changes  in  the  wage  structure.  Measured  changes  in 
the  allocation  of labor between  industries  and occupations  strongly  favored  college 
graduates  and  females  throughout  the  period.  Movements 
in  the  college  wage 
premium  over this  period appear to be strongly  related  to fluctuations  in the  rate of 
growth  of the  supply  of college  graduates. 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Wage  inequality  among  both  men  and  women 

increased 
substantially  in the United  States  during the  1980s.  Changes  in the 
wage  structure  along  three  primary  dimensions  played  an  impor- 
tant  role  in  rising  inequality.  First,  there  was  an  increase  in  wage 
differentials  by  education  with  a  particularly  sharp  rise  in  the 
relative  earnings  of college graduates.  Second,  the  average wages  of 
older  workers  increased  relative  to  the  wages  of younger  workers 
for those  with  relatively  low  levels  of education.  The  combination 
of these  two  changes  generated  an increase  in the  weekly  wages  of 
young  male  college  graduates  by approximately  30 percent  relative 
to young  males  with  twelve  or fewer  years  of schooling  from  1979 
to  1987.  Third,  earnings  inequality  also  increased  greatly  within 
narrowly  defined  demographic  and skill groups. Although  the  male 
and  female  wage  structures  widened  considerably,  differences  in 
earnings  between  men  and  women  narrowed  throughout 
the 
1980s.  The  average  wage  of  women  increased  by  about  8  percent 
relative  to the  average  wage  of men  from  1979  to  1987. 

Although  the  pattern  of  movements  in  the  U.  S.  wage  struc- 
ture  in the  1980s  is well documented,'  much disagreement  remains 
concerning  the fundamental  causes  of the changes.  Several explana-

tions  have  received  much  attention.  One  class  of  explanations 
postulates  that  changes  in  the  U.  S.  wage  structure  during  the 
1980s  are  driven  primarily  by  shifts  in  the  relative  demand  for 
labor  favoring  more-educated  and  ""more-skilled""  workers  over 
less-educated  and ""less-skilled""  workers  and favoring  females  over 
males.  One  variant  emphasizes  technological  changes  (possibly 
associated  with  the  computer  revolution)  that  are  likely  to  have 
raised  the  relative  demand  for more-educated  and flexible  workers 
and reduced the demand  for physical  labor [Davis and Haltiwanger, 
1991;  Krueger,  1991;  Mincer,  1991].  A  second  hypothesizes  that 
shifts  in product demand  largely associated  with  large trade deficits 
in  the  1980s  have  led  to  a  sharp  decline 
in  manufacturing 
employment  and  a  shift  in  employment  toward  sectors  that  are 
education  and female intensive  [Murphy and Welch,  1991]. Alterna- 
tive  explanations  focus  on  changes  in  wage-setting 
institutions 
such  as  the  decline  in  unions  [Freeman,  1991],  changes  in  pay 
norms  [Mitchell,  1989],  and  the  erosion  of  the  real  value  of  the 
minimum  wage  [Blackburn,  Bloom,  and Freeman,  1990]. 

In this  paper we examine  how far one can go toward explaining 
recent  changes  in  relative  wages  in  the  United  States  using  a 
simple  supply  and  demand  framework.  Rather  than  focusing  on 
changes  in relative  wages  during  the  1980s  in isolation,  we analyze 
relative  wage  movements  over the  longer  25-year  time  period from 
1963  to  1987.  By examining  this  longer  time  period, we are able to 
evaluate  the  ability  of  competing  explanations  to  explain  a  wide 
range  of wage  observations  (such  as both  falling  college  wage  pre- 
miums  in the  1970s  and rising  college wage premiums  in the  1980s) 
as well as differences  in timing  in changes  in wage differentials. 

The paper is organized  as follows.  Section  II describes  the  data 
from the  March Current  Population  Surveys  that  we use  through- 
out  the  paper.  Section  III  uses  these  data  to  describe  the  basic 
patterns  of change  in real  and  relative  wages  in the  United  States 
over the  1963  to  1987  period.  Section  IV outlines  the  simple  factor 
demand  model  that  we  use  to  interpret  these  relative  wage  data 
and  evaluates  the  ability  of simple  demand  shift  stories  to  explain 
the  observed  patterns  of  changes  in  relative  factor  prices  and 
supplies.  Section  V  expands  the  basic  model  to  incorporate  both 
within-  and  between-industry  components  of  relative  factor  de- 
mands.  Section  VI uses  the  basic framework  to examine  changes  in 
education  and experience  differentials.  Section  VII summarizes  our 
conclusions.

We conclude  that  rapid secular  growth  in the  relative  demand 
for  ""more-skilled""  workers  is  a  key  component  of  any  consistent 
explanation  for rising  inequality  and changes  in the wage  structure 
over  the  last  25  years.  Although  much  of  this  shift  in  relative 
demand  can  be  accounted  for by  observed  shifts  in  the  industrial 
and  occupational  composition  of  employment  toward  relatively 
skill-intensive  sectors,  the  majority  reflects  shifts  in relative  labor 
demand  occurring  within  detailed  sectors.  These  within-sector 
shifts  are likely  to reflect  skill-biased  technological  changes.  Differ- 
ences  in the time  pattern  of rising  education  differentials  and rising 
within-group  inequality  suggest  that  they  are distinct  phenomena.

II.  THE  DATA 

The  data  we  use  in  this  paper  come  from  a  series  of  25 
consecutive  March  Current  Population  Surveys  (CPSs)  for survey 
years  1964  to  1988.  These  CPS  data  are  from  the  March  Annual 
Demographic  Supplement  and  provide  information  on  earnings 
and  weeks  worked  in  the  calendar  year  preceding  the  March 
survey.  These  surveys  provide  wage  and  employment  information 
on approximately  1.4 million  workers  for the  1963  to  1987  period. 
From  these  CPS  data  we  create  two  samples:  (1)  a  wage  sample 
that  we  use  to  measure  weekly  wages  of  full-time  workers  by 
demographic  group and  (2) a count  sample  that  we use  to measure 
the  amount  of labor supplied  by each of these  demographic  groups. 
The  taxonomy  we  use  divides  the  data  into  320  distinct  labor 
groups,  distinguished  by  sex,  education  (less  than  12,  12,  13-15, 
and  16  or  more  years  of  schooling),  and  40  single-year  potential 
experience  categories  (corresponding  to the  first 40 years  since  the 
estimated  age of labor market  entrance).2 

2.  Potential  experience 

is  calculated  as  min(age  -  years  of  schooling  -  7, 

age  -  17) where  age is the  age at the  survey  date. 

38 

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF  ECONOMICS 

The  wage  measure  that  we  use  throughout  the  paper  is  the 
average  weekly  wage  of  full-time  workers  (computed  as  total 
annual  earnings  divided  by  total  weeks  worked)  within  a gender- 
education-experience  cell.3  Our  wage  sample  includes  full-time 
wage  and  salary  workers  who  participated  in the  labor force for at 
least  39  weeks  in  the  calendar  year  prior  to  the  March  survey, 
worked at least  one week,  and did not work part year  due to school, 
retirement,  or  military  service.  Self-employed  workers  and  those 
working  without  pay  were  excluded  from  the  wage  sample.  The 
sample  includes  individuals  for whom  the  Census  imputed  wages 
but  makes  a correction  for the  fact that  the  imputation  procedures 
changed  between  the  1975 and  1976 March CPS surveys.4 Workers 
with  top  coded  earnings  were  imputed  annual  earnings  at  1.45 
times  the  annual  topcode  amount.  This  correction  is based  on our 
estimates  of the  conditional  average  earnings  of  those  with  earn- 
ings  above the  topcode.  In addition,  we excluded  workers  with  real 
weekly  earnings  below  $67  in  1982  dollars  (equal to one half of the 
1982  real minimum  wage  based  on a 40-hour  week).  As best  as we 
can  ascertain  from  experimentation,  our  results  are  not  highly 
sensitive  to these  exclusion  criteria. 

The  count  sample  includes  all individuals  who  worked  at least 
one  week  in  the  preceding  year  (regardless  of  whether  they  were 
wage and salary workers,  self employed,  or otherwise).  We compute 
total  hours  worked  for  each  cell  in  each  year  by  computing  the 
product  of  total  annual  hours  (weeks  worked  times  usual  weekly 
hours)  and the  individual  CPS sample  weight  for each individual  in 

3.  Weeks  worked are available  only  on a bracketed  basis  for survey  years  prior 
to  1976.  To impute  weeks  worked  for the  1964-1975  surveys,  we  divided  the  wage 
sample  for  the  later  survey  years  into  cells  defined  by  the  weeks  worked  brackets 
used  in  the  earlier  surveys  and  sex.  We used  the  means  of weeks  worked  for these 
cells  from the  1976-1988  surveys  as our estimates  of weeks  worked  for individuals 
in the  corresponding  cells in the  earlier  surveys. 

4.  The  Census  began using  a finer classification  of observables  to impute  wages 
for  workers  who  failed  to  report  wages  in  the  1976  survey.  Since  information  on 
which  workers  had  imputed  wages  is  not  available  for  the  years  1963-1966,  one 
cannot  construct  a wage  series  using  only  workers  without  imputed  wages  for our 
entire  sample  period.  To adjust  group  average  wages  for changes  in the  imputation 
procedures,  we multiplied  the  average  wages  in each cell for the years  1963-1975  by 
a  time-invariant,  cell-specific  adjustment 
factors  were 
picked to impose  the  condition  that  the  average  percentage  wage difference  between 
the  wages  of all workers  and  those  of workers  without  wage  imputations  were  the 
same  in  the  1967-1975  and  1975-1987  periods.  Our  qualitative  findings  for  the 
1967-1987  period  are  quite  similar  when  we  use  our  adjusted  series  including 
imputed  wages  and  when  we  use  only  workers  without  wage 
workers  with 
imputations.  See Lillard, Smith,  and Welch  [1986]  for a discussion  of the  changes  in 
techniques  to impute  missing  data implemented  with  the  1976  survey.

the  cell and then  summing  over all the  individuals  in the  cell.5 We 
use  these  total  hours  measures  as  estimates  of  the  total  labor 
supplied  to the  U.  S. market  by individuals  with  given  characteris- 
tics.  The  total  hours  calculations  for each  cell are then  deflated  by 
the  sum  of total  hours  worked  over all cells  so that  hours  for each 
cell  in  each  year  are  expressed  as  a fraction  of total  annual  hours 
that  year. 

The  use  of two  separate  samples,  one  for  measuring  supplies 
and  one  for  measuring  prices,  reflects  the  different  criteria  each 
sample  must  meet.  The primary concern with  the wage sample  is to 
obtain  data  on  a  group  that  maintains  a  reasonably  constant 
composition  through  time  thus  providing  estimates  of  the  prices 
received  by workers  of given  skills.  In this  regard,  our  goal was  to 
maximize  the  comparability  through  time.  This  is why  we tried  to 
focus  on  full-time  workers  with  reasonably  strong  labor  force 
attachment.  For  purposes  of  computing  supply,  the  desire  for 
is  overridden  by  the  requirement  of  measuring  an 
homogeneity 
aggregate  quantity. 

Our wage  data can be summarized  by the  (320  x  25) matrix  W 
which  contains  the  average  weekly  wage  from the  wage  sample  for 
each  of our  320  groups  in  each  year  from  1963  to  1987.  When  we 
describe  wages  for more  aggregated  groups,  we  use  a fixed-weight 
aggregation  scheme  where  the  fixed weights  are given  by the  320- 
element  vector  of  average  employment  shares  over  the  1963  to 
1987  period  which  we  denote  N.  In  addition,  we  use  this  same 
vector  of  fixed-weights  to  construct  wage  indices  for  each  year  as 
N' W. Deflating  wages  in each year by the  value  of this  index for the 
year  generates  a  time  series  of  relative  wages  by  groups  (where 
each  group's  wage  is  indexed  to  the  wages  for  a  fixed  bundle  of 
workers).  The  average  of  these  relative  wages  through 
time 
provides  an  estimate  of the  average  relative  wage  of a given  group 
and  hence  provides  a  natural  basis  for  aggregating  quantities  of 
labor  supplied  across  groups  in  terms  of  efficiency  units.  Accord- 
ingly,  when  we  measure  quantities  of labor  in  efficiency  units,  we 
compute  more  aggregate  supplies  from the  individual  cell  supplies 

5.  Total  hours  worked  for groupj  in year t is given  by 

t  where  i indexes 
individuals,  h  is  annual  hours  worked,  and  X  is  the  CPS  sample  weight.  Usual 
weekly  hours  for  the  previous  year  are  only  available  in  the  CPS  since  1976.  For 
survey  years  1964-1975  we  use  hours  worked  during  the  survey  week  to  measure 
usual  weekly  hours  in  the  previous  year.  For individuals  who  did not  work  during 
the  survey  week,  we  imputed  usual  weekly  hours  using  the  mean  of hours  worked 
last  week  for individuals  of the  same  sex  and  same  full-time/part-time 
status  who 
reported  hours  worked last week  on that  year's  survey.

Current  Population  Surveys  for  1964-1988.  Mean  weekly  wages  for  full-time  workers  in  each  of  320 
sex-education-experience  cells  were  computed  in  each  year.  Mean  wages  for  broader  groups  in  each  year 
represent  weighted  averages  of these  cell means  using  a fixed set  of weights  (the  average  employment  share  of 
the  cell  for  the  entire  1963-1987  period).  All  earnings  numbers  are  deflated  by the  implicit  price  deflator  for 
personal  consumption  expenditures.

III.  REAL AND  RELATIVE  WAGE  CHANGES,  1963-1987 

Table  I describes  changes  in  the  real  weekly  wages  of the  full 
labor  force  and  of  individual  demographic  groups  for  the  1963- 
1987  period  and  for  three  periods,  1963-1971,  1971-1979,  and 
1979-1987.6  Over  the  entire  period  average  real  weekly  wages 

6.  We  compute  real  wages  by  deflating  nominal  wages  in  each  year  by  the 
implicit  price  deflator  for  personal  consumption  expenditures  from  the  National 
Income  and Product  Accounts. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987

increased  by  16.1 percent.7 This  growth  in real wages  breaks  down 
into  a  19.2  percent  increase  between  1963  and  1971  and  small 
subperiods.  The 
declines  during  the  1971-1979  and  1979-1987 
major  difference  between  these  computations  and  more  standard 
measures  of  average  real  wages  is  that  the  measures  in  Table  I 
refer  to  wages  for  a  fixed  demographic  distribution  (the  average 
employment  distribution  over the  1963  to  1987  period)  and  hence 
do not reflect changes  in the level of wages  arising  from shifts  in the 
education,  gender,  or experience  composition  of the  labor force. 

The  next  two  rows  of the  table  indicate  that  wages  of women 
increased  by 9 percent  relative  to the  wages  of men  over the  entire 
period.  This  reduction  in  the  overall  gender  gap  in  earnings  was 
in  the  1980s.  In  fact,  the  earnings  of  women  in- 
concentrated 
creased  relative  to those  of men  in almost  all experience-education 
cells  during  the  1980s.  Panel  A  of  Figure  I  contrasts  the  time 
pattern  of  changes  in  the  female/male  wage  ratio  for  high  school 
and college  graduates  from  1963  to  1987.8 Although  the  narrowing 
of  the  gender  gap  in  wages  started  earlier  for  college  graduates 
than  for  high  school  graduates,  the  increase  in  the  female/male 
wage  ratio  is  much  more  substantial  in  the  1980s  for high  school 
graduates. 

The  next  four  rows  of  Table  I  show  real  wage  changes  by 
education  level. For the full period, real wage changes  are monoton- 
ically  increasing  in  education  level,  reflecting  a rise  in  education- 
based  wage  differentials.  The  timing  of  the  growth  in  education 
is  very  uneven,  however.  From  1963  to  1971  college 
returns 
graduates  gained  about  8 percent  on  other  groups.  Between  1971 
and  1979  real  wages  fell  the  most  for  college  graduates,  by  10.1 
percent,  and  actually  increased  slightly  for the  two  least-educated 
groups.  In  contrast,  from  1979  to  1987  college  graduates  gained 
14.1  percent  on  high  school  dropouts  and  11.7  percent  on  high 
school  graduates.  Since  these  changes  more  than  make  up  for the 
decline  in  the  relative  wages  of  college  graduates  over  the  1970s, 
the  college  wage premium  was  higher  in the  late  1980s  than  at any 

7.  We refer to  100 times  log changes  as percentage  changes  in this  section. 
8.  The  female/male  wage  ratios  reported  in  the  figure  are  computed  by  first 
level  and  five-year  potential 
sorting  the  data  into  cells  defined  by  education 
experience  intervals.  The  reported  female/male  wage  ratios  are  fixed-weighted 
averages  of the  ratios  of the  average  weekly  wage  of females  to the  average  weekly 
wage  of males  in  each  cell where  the  fixed weight  for each  cell  is  the  cell's  average 
share  of  total  employment  over  the  entire  1963-1987  period.  The  wage  ratios 
reported  in  the  other  panels  of  Figure  I are  analogous  fixed-weighted  averages  of 
wage  ratios  for  cells  defined  by  gender,  education  level,  and  five-year  experience 
interval.

other  time  during  our  sample  and  most  likely  at  any  other  time 
during  the  postwar  period  [Goldin and Margo,  1992]. 

Panels  B  and  C of  Figure  I  further  illustrate  changes  in  the 
earnings  of  college  graduates  relative  to  high  school  graduates. 
Panel  B  documents  movements 
in  the  fixed-weighted  average 
college/high  school  wage ratio for all workers  and for workers  with 
one  to  five years  of experience.  The  figure  highlights  much  larger 
swings  in educational  differentials  for young  workers than  for older 
workers  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  In  fact,  the  college/high  school 
wage ratio for young  workers  fell from  1.61 in  1969  to  1.44 in  1979 
and  then  increased  sharply  to  1.82  in  1987.  Panel  C shows  that 
fluctuations  in  the  college  wage  premium  were  quite  similar  for 
men  and women. 

The  next  two  rows  of  Table  I examine  real  wage  changes  by 
experience  level  for males.  Over the  entire  sample  period the  wage 
gap  between  older  and  younger  workers  expanded  with  peak 
earners,  those  with  26 to 35 years  of experience,  gaining  12 percent 
on  new  entrants,  those  with  1 to  5 years  of experience.  Although 
experience  differentials  for  men  expanded  throughout  the  period, 
they  increased  most  substantially  during the  1980s. 

The  final  rows  of  Table  I  present  real  wage  movements  for 
education  by  experience  cells  for  males.  Two  distinct  patterns 
emerge.  First,  high  school  graduates  and  high  school  dropouts 
show the largest  increases  in experience  differentials  (16.3 and 10.8 
percent,  respectively)  and  for  both  groups  this  increase  is  ac- 
counted  for  entirely  by  the  rise  in  experience  returns  in  the  final 
time  interval.  For  college  graduates  the  time  series  of  experience 
returns  is quite  different.  Experience  differentials  increase  sharply 
in  both  of  the  first  two  time  intervals  so  that  from  1963  to  1979 
experienced  college graduates  gained  16.5 percent  on new entrants. 
However,  during  the  1980s  the  relative  wages  of  young  college 
graduates  increased  sharply.  The  differences  in  the  patterns  of 
changes  in  experience  differentials  for  high  school  and  college 
graduates  are graphed  in Panel  D of Figure  I. 

We  have  so  far  referred  to  changes  in  real  wages  for  groups 
distinguished  by  sex,  education,  and  experience.  However,  given 
that  these  factors  account  for  only  about  one  third  of  the  differ- 
ences  in wages  across workers,  there  is significant  room for relative 
wage changes  within  these  categories  as well. We use the dispersion 
of relative  wages  within  our gender-education-experience  cells  as a 
measure  of the  spread in relative  wages  across  different  skill  levels 
within  the  cells.  Empirically  we  do this  by looking  at the  distribu- 

44 

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 

tion  of residuals  from a regression  of log weekly  wages  on a quartic 
in  experience  fully  interacted  with  sex  and  four  education-level 
dummies,  and  linear  terms  in  education  within  these  categories. 
The  distribution  of  residuals  from  this  regression  essentially 
captures  the  dispersion  of wages  within  the  demographic  groups. 

We summarize  these  results  in panel  A of Figure  II where  we 
plot  the  differences  in  the  log  wage  residuals  of  those  at  the 
ninetieth  and  at  the  tenth  percentiles  of  the  distribution  of  log 
wage  residuals  for men  and women.  Within-group  (residual)  wage 
inequality  has  expanded  enormously  for  both  women  and  men 
from  1963  to  1987.  The  log  wage  gap  between  the  ninetieth  and 
tenth  percentile  worker  within  experience-education  groups  in- 
creased  by  approximately  0.26  for  men  and  0.21  for  women  from 
in  wage  inequality  within 
1963-1987.  This  striking 
groups  means  that  not  only  have  the  less-educated  and  less- 
experienced  workers  lost  out  over  our  sample  period  but  so  too 
have  the  ""least-skilled""  or  ""least-lucky""  workers  within  each 
category. 

increase 

An  examination  of  the  time  series  displayed  in  Panel  A  of 
Figure  II  shows  that  residual  inequality  started  to  expand  in  the 
early  1970s  and continued  increasing  rather  smoothly  in the  1980s. 
This  time  pattern  contrasts  sharply  with  the  pattern  for education 
differentials.  We conclude  from these  differences  in timing  that  the 
general  rise  in  within-group  inequality  and  the  rise  in  education 
premiums  over  the  1963-1987  period  are  actually  somewhat 
distinct  economic  phenomena.  The earlier increase  in within-group 
inequality  suggests  a rise  in  the  demand  for  ""skill""  that  predates 
the  recent  rise in returns  to education. 

We  next  examine  changes  in  overall  wage  inequality  by  sex. 
Panel  B of Figure  II plots  movements  in overall  wage  dispersion  as 
measured  by  the  log  wage  differential  between  workers  at  the 
ninetieth  and  tenth  percentiles  of  the  wage  distribution  for  men 
and for women.  The  90-10  log wage differential  for males  remained 
stable  in  the  1960s,  increased  substantially  from  1.18  in  1970  to 
1.29  in  1979,  and  then  expanded  sharply  by  0.18  log  points  from 
1979  to  1987.  Wage inequality  for females  remained  fairly stable  in 
the  1960s  and  1970s,  and then  increased  sharply  from  1.08 in  1979 
to  1.32  in  1987.  The  log wage  gap between  the  ninetieth  and tenth 
percentile  workers  increased  by  0.26  for  men  and  by  0.25  for 
women  from  1963  to  1987.  The pattern  of changes  in  overall  wage 
inequality  over  our  sample  period  is  quite  similar  if  one  uses 
alternative  summary  measures  such  as  the  variance  of log  wages,

the  interquartile  range,  or  a  gini  coefficient  [Juhn,  Murphy,  and 
Pierce,  1989;  Karoly,  1990;  Levy and  Murnane,  1991].  In fact,  the 
weekly  and  hourly  wage  distributions  for  both  men  and  women 
appear to  have  spread  out  fairly  evenly  across  all percentiles  from 
1963 to  1987. 

We conclude  that  all major relative  wage  differentials  with  the 
exception  of  the  male/female  differential  increased  from  1963  to 
1987.  These  basic  changes  in  the  U.  S.  wage  structure  can  be 
summarized  as follows. 

1. The college wage premium  rose from  1963 to  1971,  fell from 
1971  to  1979,  and  then  rose  sharply  from  1979  to  1987.  The 
changes  in the  college/high  school  wage  ratio were  greatest  for the 
youngest  workers  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  and  greatest  for  prime 
age workers  in the  1960s. 

2.  Experience  differentials  expanded  substantially  from  1963 
to  1987.  The  most  dramatic  increases  in  experience  differentials 
occurred for less-educated  males  from  1979-1987. 

3.  Overall  and  residual  weekly  wage  inequality  for  both  men 
and women  (as measured  by the  90-10  log wage  differential)  were 
stable  during  the  1960s  and  then  increased  by  almost  30  percent 
from the  late  1960s  to  1987.  The increase  in residual  inequality  has 
been  quite  steady  since the  early  1970s,  while  the  growth  in overall 
inequality  accelerated  in the  1980s. 

4.  After  remaining  fairly  stable  in  the  1960s  and  1970s, 
male/female  wage  differentials  narrowed  substantially  from  1979 
to  1987. 

IV.  A  SIMPLE  SUPPLY  AND  DEMAND  FRAMEWORK 

We begin  our examination  of the  between-group  relative  wage 
changes  documented  in the  previous  section  using  a simple  supply 
and  demand  framework  in  which  different  demographic  groups 
(identified  by sex, education,  and experience)  are treated  as distinct 
labor inputs.  We think  of the  relative  wages  of demographic  groups 
as being  generated  by the  interaction  of the  relative  supplies  of the 
groups  and  an  aggregate  production  with  its  associated  factor 
demand  schedules.  To the  extent  that  these  different  demographic 
in  production,  we  can  view 
groups  are  imperfect  substitutes 
changes  in  relative  wages  as  being  generated  by  shifts  in  relative 
supplies  and shifts  in the  factor demand  schedules.  The framework 
in  that  we  do  not  specify  the 
is  distinctly  partial  equilibrium 
determinants  of  relative  factor  supplies.  We  only  require  that 
observed  prices  and quantities  must  be ""on the  demand  curve."" 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

47 

A. The Basic  Framework 

X,=D(WZ), 

Our basic  framework  involves  an  aggregate  production  func- 
tion  consisting  of  K  types  of  labor  inputs.  We  assume  that  the 
associated  factor demands  can be written  as 
(1) 
where 
X,  =  K  x  1 vector  of labor inputs  employed  in the  market  in year  t 
W,  =  K  x  1 vector  of market  prices  for these  inputs  in year  t 
Zt  =  m  x  1 vector  of demand  shift  variables  in year  t. 
The  demand  shifters  Zt  reflect  the  effects  of  technology,  product 
demand,  and other  nonlabor  inputs  on demands  for labor inputs. 

Under  the  assumption  that  the  aggregate  production  function 
is  concave,  the  (K x  K)  matrix  of  cross-price  effects  on  factor 
demands,  DW, is negative  semidefinite.  Equation  (1) can be written 
in terms  of differentials  as 
(2) 
The negative  semidefiniteness  of DW implies  that 
(3) 
Changes  in  factor  supplies  (net  of  demand  shifts)  and  changes  in 
wages  must  negatively  covary. 

dWt'(dXt -  DzdZt) =  dWtDwdWt <  0. 

dXt =  DWdWt +  DZdZt. 

(e.g.,  Freeman 

[1979]  and  Welch  [1979]) 

One hypothesis  that  has  attracted  much  attention  in previous 
related  research 
is 
whether  shifts  in  relative  supplies  are  the  driving  force  behind 
observed  changes  in relative  wages.  A test  of an extreme  version  of 
this  hypothesis  is to examine  whether  the  data are consistent  with 
stable  factor  demand.  In this  case,  wage  changes  are generated  by 
relative  supply  changes  arising  from  changing  demographics  and 
school  completion  rates.  In  the  case  of  two  inputs  the  basic 
implication  of  stable  relative  factor  demand  is  that  an  increase  in 
the  relative  supply  of  a  group  must  lead  to  a  reduction  in  the 
relative  wage  of  that  group.  More  generally,  if  factor  demand  is 
stable  (Z  fixed), equation  t3) implies  that  dW'dXt <  O. We use  our 
estimates  of  the  time  series,  (Xt, Wt), t  =  1963,  .  . 
,  1987,  and  a 
discrete  version  of this  equation  to test  for stable  demand.  Specifi- 
cally, we test  for fixed factor demand  between  the  year  t and year  T 
by evaluating  whether 

(4) 

(Wt- W)  (Xt  XT) ?0. 

This inequality  provides a natural  way in which to evaluate  the 

48 

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF ECONOMICS 

pure  supply  shifts  story.  Periods  of time  in which  the  inequality  in 
(4)  is  satisfied  (i.e.,  the  inner  product  of  changes  in  wages  and 
changes  in  factor  supplies  is  nonpositive)  have  the  potential  to  be 
explained  solely  by  supply  shifts.  When  this  inequality 
is  not 
satisfied,  no  story  relying  entirely  on  supply  shifts  is  consistent 
with  the  data.  In this  case,  we can evaluate  alternative  hypotheses 
concerning  relative  demand  shifts  (alternative  proxies  for Z,) using 
the  discrete  version  of (3) given by 
(5) 
where  we  compute  the  inner  product  of the  change  in  wages  from 
year T to year t with  the  changes  in net  supplies  (equal to the  actual 
change  in  supply  less  the  change  in demand  for X that  would  have 
happened  at fixed factor prices). 

(Wt -  WT)'[(Xt -  XT) -  (D(WT, Z)  -  D(WT, ZT))] <  0, 

In  our  implementation  of  this  framework,  we  are  concerned 
with  explaining  relative  wage  changes  as  a  function  of  relative 
supply and relative  factor demand  shifts.  We abstract  from changes 
in absolute  wages  arising  from factor-neutral  technological  change 
and  from  neutral  demand  shifts  associated  with  changes  in  the 
scale  of  the  economy.  To  do  so,  we  use  a  relative  wage  measure 
(actual  wages  W, deflated  by the  wage  index  N'Wt,  where  N  is  the 
(K x  1) vector  of average  employment  shares  over the  entire  sam- 
ple  for  the  K  labor  inputs)  and  a  relative  supply  measure  (actual 
supplies  Xt deflated  by  the  total  supply  of  labor  in  the  economy 
measured  in  efficiency  units  f'Xt,  where  fl  is the  (K x  1) vector  of 
average relative  wages  over the  entire  sample)  when  we empirically 
evaluate  (4) and (5).9 

9.  The  use  of  these  relative  wage  and  quantity  measures  can  be  formally 
justified  as follows.  We first  assume  that  the  aggregate  production  function  can be 
written  as yt =  +  F(Xt)  where  4t indexes  the  state  of technology  of the  economy  and 
FO is concave.  The concavity  of FO implies  that 

[F. (X)  -  F (X)]'(Xt -  X)  -  0, 

where  FX is the  K  x  1 vector  of derivatives  of F with  respect  to the  K inputs.  Under 
the  assumption  that  marginal  products  are set  equal  to factor  prices,  we have  W  = 
XtF.(Xt ) for all t so that  the  inequality  can be rewritten  as 
-WT k)](Xt  X)  -  0. 

[ ( WI4) 

- 

If we  further  assume  that  there  are constant  returns  to  scale  in production  so 
that  FO  is  a linear  homogeneous  function,  then  F.(ktXt)  =  F/(Xt)  for any  scalar  kt. 
Thus,  Wt =  4~tF.(ktXt ) and  W, =  b),F/kXX)  for  any  scalars  kt and k,. This  implies 
that  the  inequality, 

[(Wt/4))  -  (W-/4)1](ktXt 

kXT)  <  0 

also holds for any scalars kt and kT. This final inequality  is the  form of (4) that  we use 
in  our empirical  tests.  We approximate  the  level  of productivity  at  time  t, 4t, using 
the  value  of our wage  index N'Wt,  and we multiply  the  factor  quantities  Xt in year  t 
by one over the  total  supply in efficiency units.

B. Relative  Supply  Changes 

Table II summarizes  changes  in relative  factor supplies  (where 
each  group's  supply  is  measured  relative  to  the  total  supply  in 
efficiency  units)  over  the  1963-1987  period  and  the  subperiods 
1963-1971,  1971-1979,  and  1979-1987 
for  the  same  aggregates 
used  to  analyze  changes  in  wages  in  Table  I.  The  table  illustrates 
that  there  has  been  substantial 
long-run  growth  in  the  relative 
supply  of  more-educated  workers,  younger  workers,  and  women. 
The  increase  in  the  average  educational  attainment  of  the  labor 
force is particularly  striking.  The  share  of aggregate  hours  worked 
contributed  by  college  graduates 
increased  from  13.0  to  26.3

a. The  numbers  in the  table  represent  log changes  in each  group's  share  of total  labor  supply  measured  in 
efficiency units  (annual  hours  times  the  average relative  wage of the group for the  1963-1987  period) using  data 
from the  March Current  Population  Surveys  for  1964-1988.  Supply  measures  include  all workers  in the  count 
sample  described  in the  text. 

50 

QUARTERLY  JOURNAL  OF ECONOMICS 

percent  from  1963-1987,  while  the  share  for high  school  dropouts 
fell  from  39.2  to  12.6  percent  over  the  same  period.  Since  the 
relative  supplies  and wages  of more-educated  workers  and women 
increased  over the  sample,  relative  demand  changes  favoring  these 
groups  are necessary  to explain  the  observed  data. 

On the  other  hand,  the  table does illustrate  the possibility  that 
differences  in  the  rate  of  growth  in  the  relative  supply  of  college 
graduates  may  help  explain  the  time  pattern  of  changes  in  the 
college wage  premium.  The largest  increase  in the  supply  of college 
graduates  comes  during  the  1971-1979  period in which  the  college 
wage  premium  declined,  and  the  smallest  growth  of supply  comes 
during  the  1979-1987  period  in  which  the  college  wage  premium 
expanded  sharply.  A  smooth  secular  increase 
in  the  relative 
demand  for college  graduates  combined  with  the  observed  fluctua- 
tions  in  the  rate  of  growth  of  relative  supply  could  potentially 
explain  the  movements  in the  college  wage  premium  from  1963  to 
1987. 

An  analogous  story  emphasizing  smooth  trend  growth  in  the 
relative  demand  for  women  and  relative  supply  growth  variation 
seems  less  likely  to  provide  a  complete  story  for  changes  in  the 
gender  gap in earnings.  The rate of growth  of the  share  of the  labor 
force  accounted  for by  women  is  more  rapid  in  the  1970s  than  in 
the  1960s  or 1980s.  The deceleration  in the rate of growth  of female 
labor  supply  in  the  1980s  combined  with  a  secular  growth  in  the 
relative  demand  for  industries  and  occupations  in  which  women 
have  been  concentrated  may  help  explain  the  greater  earnings 
gains  made by women  in the  1980s  than  in the  1970s.  On the  other 
hand,  the  acceleration  in  the  growth  rate  of  relative  supply  from 
the  1960s  to  the  1970s  bodes  poorly  for  an  explanation  based  on 
supply  growth  fluctuations  since  the  relative  earnings  of  women 
declined  in the  1960s. 

Changes  in  the  age  structure  of  the  labor  force  may  be  an 
important  part  of  an  explanation  for  secular  increases 
in  the 
relative  earnings  of  older  workers.  The  share  of  labor  supply 
(measured  in efficiency units)  accounted  for by workers  with  one to 
ten years  of experience  increased  rapidly from  18.9 percent  in  1963 
to a peak of 30.8  percent  in 1980 and then  decreased  to 27.4  percent 
in  1987.  The  secular  increase  in  the  share  of  young  workers 
consisted  of  dramatic  increases 
in  the  relative  supply  of  new 
entrants  from  the  mid-1960s  to  the  late  1970s  as  the  baby  boom 
cohorts  entered  the  labor  force  combined  with  a  sharp  decline  in 
the  share of new entrants  in the  1980s  with  the passage  of the baby

boom  cohorts  into  mid-career.  This  pattern  of changes  in  relative 
supplies  can help explain  increases  in experience  differentials  in the 
1970s,  but  it  has  some  difficulties  with  the  sharp  increases  in 
experience  differentials  for less-educated  males  in the  1980s. 

C. Can Relative  Supply  Changes  Explain  Relative  Wage Changes? 
To more formally examine  how relative  supply changes  line up 
with  the  relative  wage  changes,  we  implement  the  framework 
outlined  above.  For the  analysis  in this  section  we  divide  our  data 
into  64  distinct  labor  groups,  distinguished  by  sex,  4  education 
categories  (8-11,  12,  13-15,  and  16+  years  of  schooling),  and  8 
experience  categories  (1-5,  6-10,  11-15,  16-20,  21-25,  26-30, 
31-35,  and 36-40  years).  We begin  with  equation  (4) and compute 
the  inner  products  of  changes  in  relative  wages  with  changes  in 
relative  factor  supplies  between 
time  periods.  To  reduce  the 
number  of computations  and minimize  the impact  of measurement 
error,  we  aggregate  our  25  years  into  5  five-year  intervals  and 
compute  average  relative  wages  (relative  to  our  wage  index)  and 
average  relative  supplies  for  each  of  our  64  groups  within  these 
subperiods.  We then  compute  the  inner  products  of the  changes  in 
these  measures  of wages  and  supplies  between  each  pair  of these 
five intervals. 

The  results  of  these  calculations  are  given  in  the  top  part  of 
Table  III.  The  data  appear  to  be  reasonably  consistent  with  the 
stable  demand  hypothesis  for the  1965-1980  period. Five of the  six

comparisons  for  this  period  are  negative,  and  the  positive  one  is 
quite  small  and  might  be  difficult  to  distinguish  from  sampling 
error.  In contrast,  all comparisons  involving  the  interval  centered 
in  1985  are  positive  and  thereby  reject  a  stable  factor  demand 
structure.  Our findings  are quite  similar when  we limit  the analysis 
to men. 

Figure  III illustrates  these  patterns  by plotting  changes  in log 
relative  supplies  against  changes  in  log  relative  wages  for  the  64 
labor groups  for the  period as a whole  and for the three  subperiods. 
The  lines  drawn  in  the  figures  represent  predicted  values  from 
weighted  least  squares  regressions  of the  changes  in  log wages  on 
the  changes  in log factor supplies  for each interval  with  the weights 
being  the  employment  shares  of  each  group  in  the  initial  period. 
The four graphs  shown  in the  figure reinforce  the  findings  from the 
inner  products:  for  the  1963-1987  period  as  a  whole  and  most 
strongly  for  the  1980s,  the  groups  with  the  largest  increases  in 
relative  supplies  tended  to  have  the  largest  increases  in  relative 
looking  across  groups,  differential  supply 
wages.  Thus,  when 
growth  alone  seems  like  an  unlikely  candidate  to  explain  the 
observed  changes  in relative  wages  for the  entire  period. In fact, we 
find a negative  relationship  between  growth  in factor  supplies  and 
in relative  wages  only during the  1971-1979  period. These  findings 
indicate  that  demand  growth  was  an  important  component  of the 
change  in  factor  prices  over the  period  as a whole  and particularly 
during the  1980s.  Delineating  the  time  pattern  and nature  of these 
relative  demand  shifts  is our next  goal. 

We first  examine  whether  the  observed  wage  changes  can  be 
made  consistent  with  the  observed  pattern  of  relative  quantity 
changes  simply  by  allowing  for  smooth  trend  changes  in  relative 
demands.  Such  trend  demand  shifts  might  reflect  a steady  pace on 
nonneutral  technological  changes  or steady  changes  in  the  indus- 
trial  composition  of  employment.  To  do this,  we  regress  the  time 
series  of relative  wages  and of quantities  for each  of our 64 groups 
on  a  constant  and  a  linear  time  trend.  We  then  average  the 
residuals  over  five-year  centered  intervals  for  each  group  and 
compute  the  inner  products  in changes  in detrended  relative  prices 
and relative  quantities.  The  results  of this  procedure  are shown  in 
the  bottom  half of Table III. Comparing  these  numbers  with  those 
obtained  without  correcting  for  trend  changes,  we  see  that  many 
more  of  the  comparisons  now  show  negative  inner  products.  We 
infer  from  this  that  trend  demand  growth  alone  can  make  almost 
all  of  the  observed  price  and  quantity  changes  consistent  with

otherwise  stable  demand,  although  the  remaining  positive  inner 
product for the  1980s  in detrended  changes  suggests  some accelera- 
tion in the rate of growth  of demand  for women  and more-educated 
workers  in the  1980s  appears  necessary. 

V.  MEASURING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE DEMAND FOR LABOR 
It is  clear that  substantial  shifts  in  relative  labor demand  are 
necessary  to  explain  observed  changes  in the  wage  structure  since 
the  early  1960s  as  reflecting  changes  in  relative  competitive  wage 
levels.  Changes  in  the  structure  of  product  demand,  increased 
international  competition,  and  skill-biased  technological  change 
have  attracted  much  attention  as  possible  reasons  for  shifts  in 
labor  demand  against  less-educated  males.  We  find  it  useful  to 
think  of relative  labor demand  shifts  as  coming  from  two  types  of 
changes:  those  that  occur within  industries  (i.e.,  shifts  that  change 
the  relative  factor  intensities  within  industries  at  fixed  relative 
wages)  and  those  that  occur  between  industries  (i.e.,  shifts  that 
change  the  allocation  of total  labor  demand  between  industries  at 
fixed  relative  wages).  Important  sources  of within-industry  shifts 
include  factor  nonneutral  technological  change,  changes  in  prices 
of  nonlabor  inputs  (e.g.,  computer  services),  and  ""outsourcing"" 
(shifts  of portions  of industry  production  out  of the  United  States). 
shifts  in  demand  may  be  driven  by  shifts  in 
Between-industry 
product  demand  across  industries,  sectoral  differences  in  factor- 
neutral  total  factor  productivity  growth,  and  shifts  in net  interna- 
tional  trade  which  change  the  domestic  share  of  output  at  fixed 
relative  wages. 

The  effect  of between-industry  shifts  in  labor  demand  on  the 
relative  demands  for  different  demographic  groups  depends  on 
group differences  in industrial  employment  distributions.  Table IV 
presents  the  distributions  of  employment  among  twelve  broad 
industries  and  three  major  occupational  categories  of  six  gender- 
education  groups.10 The  distributions  in  the  table  are the  average 
distributions  for  each  group  over  the  1967  to  1987  period.11 The 
substantial  differences  in  employment  distributions  indicate  that 

10.  We  focus  on  gender-education  groups  because  differences  in  industrial 
distributions  by  sex  and  education  are  much  more  significant  than  differences  by 
experience  level. 

11.  Because  of  incompatibilities  between  the  industry  and  occupation  codes 
available  in the  1964-1967  CPS surveys  and those  in the  later  surveys,  we limit  our 
analysis  of shifts  in labor demand  arising  from shifts  across industry  and occupation 
cells to the  1967-1987  period.

equipment,  automobile,  other  transport  equipment  (excluding  aircraft),  tobacco,  paper,  printing,  rubber,  and 
miscellaneous  manufacturing  industries.  High  tech  manufacturing  includes  the  aircraft,  instruments,  chemi- 
cals, and petroleum  industries. 

shifts  in  labor  demand  across  industries  and  occupations  may 
greatly  affect the  relative  wages  of these  groups. 

Table  V  illustrates  that  large  changes  occurred  in  the  indus- 
trial  and  occupational  distribution  of  total  employment  over  the 
1967-1987  period. The shift  over the entire  period in the industrial 
employment  distribution  out  of  ""low tech""  and  ""basic""  manufac- 
turing  and into professional  and business  services  is suggestive  of a 
trend  demand  shift  in favor of college  graduates  and of women  and 
against  less-educated  males.  The  substantial  decline  in importance 
of production  worker jobs points  toward  similar  demand  shifts. 

If  within-industry  relative  factor  demand  is  stable  so  that 
changes  in  the  wage  structure  are  entirely  explained  by between-

industry  shifts  in  labor demand  and relative  supply  changes,  then 
the  shares  of  industrial  employment  of  groups  whose  relative 
wages  have  increased  should  tend  to  fall  inside  every  industry. 
Thus,  the  hypothesis  of  stable  within-industry  demand  implies 
that  the  shares  of  women  and  college  graduates  should  have 
declined  in all industries.  Since  the  share  of aggregate  employment 
of  women  and  college  graduates  increased  over  this  period,  this 
scenario  requires  a substantial  shift  in employment  into  industries 
that  intensively  employ  women  and  more-educated  workers.  In 
fact,  an  examination  of  our  CPS  data  indicates  that  the  shares  of 
employment  (measured  either  in  total  hours  or  efficiency  units) 
accounted  for  by  women  and  by  college  graduates  increased  in

almost  every two-digit  industry  both  from  1963 to  1987  and during 
the  1980s.12  This  finding  indicates  that  within-industry  demand 
shifts  favoring  these  groups  must  have  occurred.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  finding  that  within-industry  shifts  must  have  occurred 
does  not  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  between-industry  shifts 
suggested  by Table V are an important  factor in explaining  relative 
wage  changes.  We  next  more  formally  develop  and  implement  a 
procedure  for  assessing  the  magnitude  of  between-  and  within- 
industry  shifts  in relative  labor demands. 

A. Conceptual  Framework 

One  widely  used  measure  of  the  effect  of  between-sector 
demand  shifts  on  relative  labor  demands  is  the  fixed-coefficient 
index  (e.g.,  Freeman  [1975,  1980]). 
""manpower  requirements"" 
This  index  measures  the  percentage  change  in  the  demand  for  a 
demographic  group  as the  weighted  average  of percentage  employ- 
ment  growth  by  industry  where  the  weights  are  the  industrial 
employment  distribution  for  the  demographic  group  in  a  base 
period.'3  In  this  section  we  clarify  the  interpretation  of  these 
demand  shift  measures.  These  simple  demand  shift  indices  provide 
appropriate  demand  shift  measures  for implementing  equation  (3) 
to  determine  whether  within-sector  relative  demand  shifts  are 
necessary  to  explain  observed  shifts  in  relative  wages.  Although 
they  provide biased  measures  of ""true""  between-sector  relative  de- 
mand  shifts  if relative  wages  are not  stable,  the  nature  of the  bias 
can be determined.  These  demand  shift  indices  tend  to understate 
the  relative  demand  shift  favoring  groups  with  increases  in relative 
prices. 

We begin  our formal  analysis  by considering  an  economy  that 
consists  of J  sectors  (which  can  be  thought  of  as  industries  or as 
industry-occupation  cells)  and K labor inputs.  We denote  output  in 
sector  J  by  Yj and  assume  that  production  takes  place  under 
constant  returns  to  scale  in  all  sectors.  We can  write  the  (K  x  1) 
vector  of factor demands  in sectorj,  Xj, as 

(6) 

Xj =  C  (MW)Yj, 

12.  Davis  and  Haltiwanger  [1991]  and  Gottschalk  and  Joyce  [1991]  similarly 
employment  shares  of  groups 

report  for  the  1980s  that  the  within-industry 
increased  with  increases  in relative  wages. 

13.  This  proxy for the  percentage  change  in  demand  for demographic  group k

can be written  as 
all demographic  groups  in  industryj,  XJk =  EJk/(JE  Jk) in  a Iase  year,  and  EJk is the 
employment  of group k in industryj.

(i.e., the  partial derivatives  of the  unit  cost function  in sectorj  with 
respect  to  each  group's  own  wage).  Equation  (6) can be written  in 
terms  of differentials  as

homogeneous  of degree  zero in factor prices,  we derive 

(8a) 

or 

(8b) 

W'dXj =  W'X_(dYjJY1) 

dYj  W'dX1 
y.  W'X, 

so  that  we  can  measure  the  percentage  change  in  outputs  by  the 
value  weighted  percentage  change  in inputs. 

This  result  is  particularly  useful,  since  aggregating  (7) across 

sectors  yields

where  dX  is  the  (K x  1) vector  of employment  changes  and  Cww is 
the  (K x  K)  matrix  that  corresponds  to  the  production-weighted 
average  of the  Hessians  (second  partial derivatives)  of the  unit  cost 
functions  for the  J  industries  and  is  negative  semidefinite.  Equa- 
tion  (9) implies  that 

(10) 

d w'(  dX -  EX  Wf

Equation  (10)  is  of  the  form  given  in  equation  (3).  Thus,  an 
appropriate  between-sector  demand  shift  measure  to  evaluate 
whether  the  data are consistent  with  stable  demand  within-sectors 
is the  (K x  1) vector; 

(11) 

AD=  >X  W'dXj 

which  is simply the  vector  of weighted  sums  of sector  employments 
for each factor with  the  weights  given by the  percentage  changes  in 
the  value  of  inputs  in  each  sector.  This  demand  shift  index  is 
exactly  the  standard  fixed-coefficients  index  with  sectoral  employ- 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987

ment  changes  measured  in  efficiency  units  rather  than  in  raw 
hours.  The intuitive  interpretation  of the  index is that  those  inputs 
employed  heavily  in expanding  sectors  will have increased  demand, 
while  those  inputs  employed  mostly  in contracting  sectors  will have 
falling  demand. 

It  is  important  to  note  at  this  point  that  all  quantities 

in 
equation  (11)  are  the  equilibrium  changes  in  factor  employments 
and  are  thereby  directly  measurable.  No  presumption  has  been 
made  as  to  the  source  of the  changes  in  employments  other  than 
the  fact  that  the  sector-specific  unit  cost  functions  are being  held 
fixed.'4 Although  the  demand  index  given  in  equation  (11)  can  be 
directly  inserted  into  equation  (10)  to  test  for  the  stability  of 
demand  within  sectors,  this  demand  index  does  not  provide  an 
unbiased  measure  of ""true"" between-industry  demand  shifts  when 
relative  wages  are changing. 

The  reason  for this  bias  is  that  changes  in  relative  wages  can 
affect  the  distribution  of  sectoral  outputs  so  that  AD  will  not 
measure  the  effects  of  changes  in  the  allocation  of  labor  demand 
across  sectors  at fixed relative  wages.  The  output  shares  of sectors 
that  intensively  employ  groups  with  relative  wage  increases  are 
likely to fall relative  to what  they  would have been at stable  relative 
wages.  Thus,  AD  is  likely  to  be  a  downward  biased  measure  of 
demand  shifts  in favor of groups  with  relative  wage  increases. 

More  formally,  we  can  write  the  (J  x  1) vector  of  changes  in 

relative  outputs,  dYj, as 

dY  =  dY*  +  YpdP =  dY*  +  YPCWdW, 

(12) 
where  dY*  is  the  (J  x  1) vector  of  ""true""  product  demand  shifts 
computed  at  fixed  factor  prices,  P  is  the  (J  x  1)  vector  of  sector 
output  prices,  Yp is the  (J  x  J)  matrix  of derivatives  with  respect  to 
the  price  vector  of  the  sectoral  demand  functions,  and  C.  is  the 
(J  x  K)  matrix  of derivatives  of the  unit  cost function  with  respect 
to  own  wages.  The  second  equality  arises  from  the  assumption  of 
constant  returns  to scale which  implies  that  dP  =  C.(W)  dW. Using 
equations  (6),  (8a),  (11),  and  (12),  we  can write  our  demand  index 
as 

(13) 

AD  =  E  C&(W)dYj =  (CW)'dY= (C,)IdY*  +  (C,)'YpCw dW. 

Equation  (13) gives  our demand  shift  measure  in terms  of the  true 

14.  Katz  and  Murphy  [1990]  show  that  this  demand  measure  is  appropriate 

even  in the  presence  of within-sector,  factor-neutral  technological  change.

factor  demand  shift  (C.)'dY*  and  a  bias  term  (C.)'YpC~dW.  If 
(as  will  be  the  case  in  the 
(C,,)'YpCw is  negative  semidefinite 
absence  of income  effects),  this bias term will be inversely  related to 
wage changes  on average  (i.e., the  inner  product  of dW and the bias 
term will be nonpositive).  In the two-factor  case the between-sector 
demand  index  given  in  equation  (11)  will  understate  the  demand 
increase  for  those  groups  with  rising  relative  wages.  More  gener- 
ally, our demand  shift  index will tend  to understate  the  magnitude 
of the true  relative  demand  shifts  favoring  groups with  increases  in 
relative  wages. 

B. Measured  Demand  Shifts,  1967-1987 

To  implement  this  approach  to  measuring  demand  shifts,  we 
divide  the  economy  into  50  two-digit  industries  and  3  occupation 
categories  and  take  the  resulting  150  industry-occupation  cells  as 
our  sectors.  The  advantage  of  adding  occupations  to  the  industry 
taxonomies  used in most  previous  work is that  doing so allows us to 
look at some  dimensions  of within-industry  shifts  in labor demand, 
as well  as between-industry  shifts.  In this  framework  we can think 
of occupations  as  producing  intermediate  goods  within  industries. 
Empirically  we  construct  our  demand  shift  measure  to  corre- 
spond  to  the  index  AD  defined  in  equation  (11).  We  specify  our 
index  of  the  between-sector  change  in  demand  for  group  k  mea- 
sured  relative  to  base  year  employment  of  group  k  in  efficiency 
units,  Ek, as 

(14) 

AXd  ADk 

(EJk)(EJ) 

Aj 

= 

wherej  indexes  sector, Ej is total  labor input  in sectorj  measured  in 
(Ejk/EJ) is  group  k's  share  of  total 
efficiency  units,  and  ?k 
employment  in  efficiency  units  in  sector j  in  the  base  year.  This 
measure  expresses  the  percentage  change  in  demand  for  each 
group  as  a weighted  average  of the  percentage  changes  in  sectoral 
employments  (measured  in  efficiency  units)  in  which  the  weights 
are  group-specific  employment  distributions.  We  turn  equation 
(14)  into  an  index  of  relative  demand  shifts  by  normalizing  all 
employment  measures  so that  total  employment  in efficiency units 
in each year  sums  to one. We choose  the  average  of the  1967-1987 
sample  period  to  be  our  base  period.15  Thus,  we  use  the  average 

15.  Our  basic  qualitative  findings  concerning  measured  demand  shifts  are 

insensitive  to choice of base year. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987

share of total  employment  in sectorj  of group k over the  1967-198  7 
period  as  our  measure  of  Ujk  and  the  average  share  of  group  k  in 
total  employment  over the  1967-1987  period as our measure  of Ek. 
We  define  our  overall  (industry-occupation)  demand  shift 
index  for group  k,  zXX', as  the  index  given  in  (14)  when  j  indexes 
our  150  industry-occupation  cells.  We  also  decompose  this  index 
into  between-  and  within-industry 
components.  The  between- 
industry  demand  shift  index  for group k, AX', is given by the  index 
in  (14)  when  j  refers  to  50  industries.  We  define  our  within- 
industry  demand  shift  index  for k,  AXw, as the  difference  between 
the  overall  demand  shift  index  and  the  between-industry  demand 
shift  index  (i.e.,  AX  -  AX'  -  AXX).  These  within-industry  de- 
mand shifts  reflect shifts  in employment  among  occupations  within 
industries. 

Table VI presents  our relative  demand  shift  estimates  for eight 
demographic  groups  for the  entire  1967-1987  period and for three 
subperiods.  The  overall  measure  of  demand  shifts  for  the  entire 
period  is monotonically  increasing  in  education  level  for both  men 
and  women.  The  overall  measure  also  shifted  in  favor  of  women 
relative  to  men  within  every  education  group  from  1967  to  1987. 
Since  education  differentials  expanded  and  gender  differentials 
narrowed  over  the  1967-1987  period,  the  actual  between-sector 
demand  shifts  toward  more-educated  workers  and  women  that 
would  have  occurred  at  fixed-factor  prices  are  likely  to  have  been 
even  greater  than  the  increases  indicated  in  Table VI.  The  overall 
measure  indicates  that  between-sector  shifts  in  employment 
in- 
creased  the  demand  for male  college  graduates  by over  30  percent 
relative  to  males  with  twelve  or fewer  years  of schooling.  Demand 
shifts  in  favor  of women  are  much  greater  for high  school  gradu- 
ates  and those  with  some  college  than  for high  school  dropouts  and 
college  graduates.  These  differences  reflect  the  concentration  of 
males  but  not  females  with  12 to  15 years  of  schooling  in  produc- 
tion  occupations  and manufacturing  industries. 

Although  the  measured  demand  shifts  toward  more-educated 
workers  and  toward  women  have  been  substantial, 
they  are 
significantly  smaller  than  the  observed  relative  supply  changes 
in  Table  II.  Thus,  changes  in  relative  wages  and 
documented 
changes  in  relative  supplies  net  of  changes  in  the  between-sector 
demand  shift  index  positively  covary  over  the  1967-1987  and  the 
1979-1987  period.  Demand  shifts  within  our  industry-occupation 
cells  are  required  to  explain  the  observed  extent  of  positive 
covariation  in changes  in relative  wages  and relative  supplies.

Table VI also  suggests  that  the  pace of overall  demand  growth 
for  college  graduates  appears  to  have  been  relatively  steady  over 
the  1967-1987  period.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  some  differ- 
ences  in  the  time  pattern  of  shifts  in  the  demand  for  female  and 
male  college  graduates.  The  magnitude  of  relative  demand  shifts 
favoring  college  males  appears  to  have  increased  in  the  1980s, 
while  demand  shifts  favoring  female  college  graduates  are smaller 
in  the  1980s  than  in  the  earlier  periods.  These  differences  reflect 
the  rapid  growth  of  the  professional  and  business  services  in  the 
1980s  and the  decline  in relative  employment  in education  and the 
public sector  in this  same period. Furthermore,  the  overall demand 
in  the  between-  and 
shift  index  masks  important  differences 
within-industry  measures  of  demand  shifts.  Between-industry 
shifts  for college graduates  appear to have decelerated  in the  1980s, 
while  within-industry  demand  shifts  (largely  reflecting  an acceler- 
ating  rate  of  decline  in  the  share  of  production  jobs  within 
industries)  have accelerated  throughout  the  period. 

C. Demand  Shifts  Arising  from  Changes  in International  Trade 

We  next  examine  the  importance  of  changes  in  net  interna- 
tional  trade  in  manufactured  goods  as  a  source  of  relative  labor 
demand  shifts.16  Many have  argued that  increased  import  competi- 
tion  particularly  with  the  large U.  S. trade deficits  of the  1980s  has 
played an important  role in shifting  employment  out of manufactur- 
ing  sectors  and  shifting  relative  demand  against  less-educated 
workers. 

To  estimate  the  labor  supply  equivalents  of  trade,  we  trans- 
form  trade  flows  into  equivalent  bodies  on  the  basis  of  the 
utilization  of  labor  inputs  in  the  domestic  manufacturing  indus- 
tries  that  constitute  the  bulk  of the  traded goods  sector.  We do this 
by  estimating  the  direct  labor  supply  embodied  in  trade,  ignoring 
indirect  input-output  effects.  Thus,  the  implicit  labor  supply  in 
trade is the  labor input  required to produce traded  output  domesti- 
cally. Formally,  we let Ii, be net  imports  in industry  i in year t, Yi, be 
domestic  output  of industry  i in year t, and Ei, be the  share  of total 
efficiency  units  in the  U.  S. economy  in year  t employed  in  sector  i 
(IiEi,  =  1). The implicit  supply  of labor embodied  in net  imports  in 
industry  i in year t measured  as a fraction  of total  U.  S. labor input 

16.  See  Borjas,  Freeman,  and  Katz  [1992]  and  Murphy  and  Welch  [1991]  for 
more detailed  treatments  of the  effects  of international  trade flows on relative  labor 
demands.

is given  by (Ei,1Yi,)*Ii,. The  implicit  supply  of labor of demographic 
group  k  contained  in  net  trade  in  year  t  as  a  fraction  of  total 
domestic  labor supply  of k is given by 

(15) 

L= 

z  eEt 

where  ek  is  the  average  proportion  of  employment  (measured  in 
efficiency  units)  in  industry  i made  up  of workers  in  group  k over 
the  1967-1987  period. 

We measure  the  effect  of trade  on  relative  demand  for  demo- 

graphic group k in year t as 

(16) 

Tt  =  -  (E) z 

[eTE t (%)] +  E  Eit 

where  Ek  is  the  average  share  of  total  employment  in  efficiency 
units  of group k for the  1967-1987  period.  The  first term  is simply 
the  implicit  supply  of  the  labor  of  group  k  contained  in  trade 
normalized  by base year  employment  of k with  the  sign  reversed  to 
convert  this  supply  shift  measure  into  a  demand  shift  measure. 
The  second  term  adjusts  the  demand  shift  measure  so  that  trade 
affects  only relative  demands  for labor. 17 

In  equation  (16)  we  assume  that  trade-induced  changes  in  an 
industry's  output  alter the  employment  of production  and nonpro- 
duction  workers  in  that  industry  in  the  same  manner  as  would 
domestic-induced  changes  in  output.  Alternatively,  however,  it  is 
plausible  that  exports  and  imports  may  affect  quite  different 
portions  of  an  industry  and  may  have  differential  impacts  on  the 
employment  of production  and nonproduction  workers.  In particu- 
lar,  while  exports  and  production  for  domestic  consumption  may 
create  employment  for both  kinds  of workers  in a similar  manner, 
imports  may  displace  production  workers  to  a  far  greater  extent 
than  they  displace  nonproduction  workers.  In fact,  many  activities 
of nonproduction  workers  (e.g.,  marketing,  sales,  accounting)  may 
be relatively  complementary  with  production  workers  overseas.  To 
take  into  account  this  issue,  we provide two estimates  of the  effects 
of trade  on  employment.  Under  the  first  method  which  we  denote 
""equal  allocation,""  we  directly  employ  equation  (16)  and treat  net 
imports  in  a manner  analogous  to  domestic  production  for domes- 

17.  This  demand  shift  index  has  the  property  that  EkTk  E k  =  0.  Murphy  and 

Welch  [1991]  provide a formal justification  for this  type  of demand  shift  index. 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

65 

tic consumption.  Under  the  second  method  which  we denote  ""pro- 
duction  worker  allocation,""  we  modify  the  first  term  in  equation 
(16) so that  exports  are allocated  to all workers  in the  same  manner 
as domestic  production  for domestic  consumption,  but  imports  are 
allocated  to production  workers  only.'8 

We use  data  on  imports,  exports,  and  output  from  the  NBER 
Immigration,  Trade,  and  Labor Market  Data  Files  to  compute  the 
trade ratios used in the construction  of our indices  of demand  shifts 
arising  from  trade.'9 These  data  cover  four-digit  SIC manufactur- 
ing industries  for each year from  1967 to  1985.  We aggregate  these 
data into  21 two-digit  manufacturing  industries. 

Table  VII  presents  the  changes 

in  relative  labor  demand 
predicted by changes  in international  trade in manufactures  for the 
1967-1973,  1973-1979,  and  1979-1985  periods.  The  table  indi- 
cates  that  the  effects  on relative  labor demands  of trade  were  quite 
moderate  until  substantial  trade  deficits  developed  in  the  1980s. 
The  adverse  effects  of trade  on  relative  labor  demand  are  concen- 
trated  on  high  school  dropouts.  Female  dropouts  who  have  tradi- 
tionally been employed intensively  as production  workers in import- 
competing  industries  such  as  apparel  and  textiles  are  the  group 
most  affected  by  trade.  In  fact,  demand  changes  from  trade  are 
larger  for  female  high  school  dropouts  in  the  1980s  than  are 
domestic  sources  of between-sector  demand  shifts.  The  table  also 
indicates  that  the  effects  of  trade  on  relative  labor  demand  are 
substantially  larger  when  imports  are  assumed  to  disproportion- 
ately  affect  production  workers.  Although  trade-induced  changes 
in  relative  demand  move  in  the  correct  direction  to  help  explain 
rising  education  differentials  in  the  1980s,  they  are  quite  small 
relative  to  the  increases  in  the  relative  supplies  of  more-educated 
workers  over the  same  period. 

18.  We replace the  first term  on the  right-hand  side of the  equation  (16) with 

l1 

(M[ 

Xt)] 

'Ej 

t) 

where X measures  exports, M measures  imports,  andpk  is group k's average  share  of 
production  worker employment  in industry  i over the 
1-X9a7 period. We classify 
as production  workers  those  workers  in  the  manufacturing  sector  in  the  following 
broad  occupational  categories:  craft  workers,  handlers  and  laborers,  operatives, 
transport  operatives,  and service  workers. 

19.  Abowd  [1991]  provides  a  detailed  discussion  of  this  data  set  and  the 
construction  of  trade  data  on  a four-digit  SIC  industry  basis.  The  data  on  output 
and employment  in each  industry  given  by the  NBER  data set  are from the  Annual 
Survey  of Manufactures.

VI.  UNDERSTANDING  CHANGES  IN  EDUCATION  AND  EXPERIENCE 

DIFFERENTIALS 

A. Education  Differentials 

The college/high  school wage premium  increased  from  1963 to 
1971,  fell  from  1971  through  1979,  and  then  rose  sharply  after 
1979.  There  are  two  primary  types  of  explanations 
for  these 
movements  in  the  college/high  school  wage  differential.  The  first 
in  relative  earnings  as  representing 
interprets 
changes  in  the  relative  market  price  of  skills  possessed  by  college 
and high  school graduates. 

these  changes 

The  second  type  of  explanation  focuses  on  changes  in  the 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

67 

composition  of  college  and  high  school  graduates  that  affect  the 
relative  skill  levels  of  the  two  groups.  This  type  of  explanation 
interprets  the  decline  in the  college  wage  premium  in the  1970s  as 
reflecting  a decline  in the  relative  quality  of college  graduates  and 
the  rise  in education  returns  in the  1980s  as reflecting  a decline  in 
the  relative  quality  of  high  school  graduates.  Because  within- 
cohort  comparisons  are likely  to hold the  relative  quality  of college 
and  high  school  graduates  relatively  constant,  this  hypothesis 
suggests  one  should  not  find  important  within-cohort  changes  in 
the  college  wage  premium.  Since  movements  in  the  college/high 
school wage differential  are quite  similar  within  cohorts  and within 
experience  levels  over  our  sample  period  [Blackburn,  Bloom,  and 
it  is 
Freeman,  1990;  Katz  and  Murphy,  1990],  we  conclude 
appropriate to view differences  in the movement  in the  college wage 
premium  in  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s  as  largely  reflecting 
in  the  relative  price  of  college  skills  rather  than  as 
changes 
in  the  relative  quality  of  college 
primarily  reflecting  changes 
graduates.  Thus,  we  turn  to  evaluating  supply  and  demand  expla- 
nations  for changes  in the  relative  price of college  skills. 

We  take  the  overall  college/high  school  wage  ratio  for  males 
and  females  combined  as  the  relative  price  to  be  explained.20 We 
amalgamate  our  320  groups  into  two  labor  aggregates:  college 
equivalent  workers  and high  school  equivalent  workers.  We use  the 
relative  quantity  of  college  and  high  school  equivalents  as  our 
relative  supply variable in assessing  explanations  for movements  in 
the  college/high  school  wage ratio. 

We create  our measures  of college  and high  school  equivalents 
as  follows.  We  construct  aggregate  labor  inputs  (using  a  fixed- 
weight  total  supply  measure  with  weights  proportional  to  average 
wages  over  the  1963-1987  period)  for  each  of  our  four  education 
groups  (8-11,  12,  13-15,  and  16+  years  of  schooling).  We  treat 
high  school  graduates  (those  with  twelve  years  of  schooling)  as 
pure  high  school  equivalents,  and  we  treat  college  graduates  as 
pure  college  equivalents.  We  allocate  other  categories  of  workers 
(those  with  less  than  twelve  years  of schooling  and those  with  some 
college)  to  our  two  aggregate  groups  on  the  basis  of  regressions 
determining  the  extent  to which  their  wages  move with  the  wage of 

20.  In  this  section  we  measure  the  college/high 

school  wage  ratio  as  the 
fixed-weight  average  of the  ratio  of the  average  weekly  wage  of college  graduates  to 
the average weekly  wage of high school  graduates  for sixteen  cells defined by sex and 
five-year  experience  brackets.  The  fixed  weight  for  each  cell  is  the  cell's  average 
share of total  employment  over the  1963-1987  period. This  series  is plotted  in Panel 
B of Figure  I as the  college/high  school  wage ratio  for all experience  levels.

high  school  graduates  and  college  graduates,  respectively.  For 
those  with  less  than  a  high  school  degree  and  those  with  some 
college,  we  regress  the  average  wage  series  for  each  of  these  two 
groups  on the  wage  series  for high  school  graduates  and for college 
graduates  over the  1963-1987  period.2  (The implicit  assumption  is 
that  each  group  is  a linear  combination  of college  and  high  school 
graduates).  The  regression  results  suggest  that  one  person  with 
some  college  is  equivalent  to  a  total  of  0.69  of  a  high  school 
graduate  and  0.29  of  a  college  graduate,  while  a  high  school 
dropout is equivalent  to 0.93  of a high  school graduate  and  -0.05  of 
a  college  graduate.  We  use  these  coefficients  to  allocate  the 
corresponding  quantities  of  high  school  dropouts  and  those  with 
some  college  to  the  high  school  and  college  quantities  to  form  the 
supplies  of high  school  and college  equivalents. 

We  consider  the  simplest  CES  technology  with  two  factors 
(college  and high  school  equivalents)  so that  relative  wages  in year 
t,  w,(t)/w,(t),  and  relative  supplies  in  year  t, x,(t)/x2(t),  satisfy  the 
relationship 

(17) 

log  (wi(t)= 

(A) [D(t) -g  (xl(t))] 

where  u is  the  elasticity  of  substitution  between  college  and  high 
school  equivalents  and  D(t)  is  the  time  series  of  relative  demand 
shifts  measured  in  log  quantity  units.  Given  that  there  are  other 
inputs  in  the  production  function,  this  is  a  conditional  factor 
demand  framework  which  requires  that  demand  shifts  be  defined 
to  include  the  effects  of changes  in  the  prices  (or equivalently  the 
supplies)  of these  other  inputs. 

The  elasticity  of  substitution 

is  an  unknown  parameter,  and 
the  time  series  of D(t)  is unobservable.  Under  the  assumption  that 
the  economy  operates  on the  demand  curve given  by equation  (17), 
a  given  value  of  the  elasticity  of  substitution  between  factors 
(a  =  (,,) implies  a time  series  of demand  shifts: 
(18) 
The  greater  the  elasticity  of substitution  between  the  two  factors, 
the  smaller  the  impact  of  shifts  in  relative  supplies  on  relative 
wages  and  the  greater  must  be  the  fluctuations  in D(t)  to  explain 
any  given  time  series  of  relative  prices  for  a  given  time  series  of 
observed  relative  quantities. 

D(t) =  Uo log  (w1(t)/w2(t)) +  log  (x,(t)/x,(t)). 

21.  The regressions  do not contain  intercept  terms.

We take  two  approaches  to  developing  stories  consistent  with 
the  observed  time  series  on  prices  and  quantities.  The  first  is  to 
estimate  u  by  running  (17)  by  ordinary  least  squares  under  the 
that  D(t)  is  approximated  by  a  simple  linear  time 
assumption 
trend.  We are somewhat  skeptical  of estimates  of u recovered  from 
25  nonindependent  time  series  observations.  Our second  approach 
is to use  equation  (18) to impute  D (t) conditional  on a choice for the 
value  of  u.  For  any  given  value  of  u,  we  can  evaluate  the  implied 
explanation  by examining  whether  the  implied  time  series  for D (t) 
matches  well  with  the  measures  of between-  and  within-industry 
demand  shifts  developed  in the  previous  section. 

The  basic  movements  in  our  relative  price  and  relative  quan- 
tity  measures  over  our  sample  period  are  summarized  in  the  top 
part  of Table VIII.  The  relative  supply  of college  equivalents  grew 
tremendously  over  this  period,  and  the  college  wage  premium 
increased  substantially.  A regression  of the  log  of the  ratio  of the 
supply  of college  to  high  school  equivalents  on a linear  time  trend 
for the  1963-1987  period yields  a coefficient  of 0.045  (t = 41.5),  and 
the log relative  price series  is almost  orthogonal  to trend.  Hence  the 
relative  demand  for  college  equivalents  has  grown  by  about  4.5 
percent  per year on average  over the  sample  period. 

The  key  question  to  be  addressed  is  the  degree  to  which  the 
time  series  of  the  college  wage  premium  has  been  driven  by 
fluctuations  in  the  growth  of  supply  versus  the  extent  to  which  it 
has  been  driven  by fluctuations  in  demand-side  factors.  Figure  IV 
graphs  the  detrended  wage  and  price  series  (in  Panels  A  and  B). 
Since  the  price series  has  little  trend,  the  series  in  Panel  A is quite 
similar  to the  overall  returns  to  college  series.  The  quantity  series 
plotted  in  Panel  B  and  summarized  in  Table  VIII  reveals  some 
important  features,  however:  supply  grew  more  slowly  than  aver- 
age  from  1963-1971, 
faster  than  average  from  1971  until  about 
1979,  and  then  more  slowly  than  average  again  in  the  1980s.  It 
in  supply 
appears  that  an  explanation  emphasizing  fluctuations 
growth  has  the  potential  to  explain  observed  fluctuations  in  the 
college wage premium. 

Thus,  the  model  in equation  (17)  in which  D(t)  is proxied  by a 
linear  time  trend  may fit the  data reasonably  well.  OLS estimation 
of this  equation  for the  1963-1987  period yields 

(19) 

log (w1/w2) =  -0.709 

log (x1/x2) +  0.033  time  + constant, 

(0.150) 

(0.007) 

with  an R2  of 0.52.  The  estimate  of u in  (19) implies  an elasticity  of

substitution  between  college  and  high  school  labor  of  about  1.41. 
The  actual  time  series  of college  returns  and the  fitted  values  from 
this  regression  are  shown  together  in  Panel  C of  Figure  IV.  The 
figure  shows  that  this  model  does  a tolerable  job  of explaining  the 
movements  in the  college wage premium  except for the  period from 
the  late  1970s  to the  early  1980s. 

Panel  D in Figure  IV shows  the  implied  demand  series  derived 
from  (18)  for  elasticities  of  substitution  of  0.5,  1.41,  and  4  with 
demand  normalized  to  equal  0 in  1963.  The  figure  illustrates  that 
there  is  a  one-dimensional  family  of  implied  demand  shifts  (in- 
dexed  by  a)  that  are  consistent  with  the  observed  price  and 
quantity  time  series.  The  implied  demand  shifts  range  from 
relatively  steady  demand  growth  when  a  is  small  (0.5  to  1)  to 
demand  growth  which  slows  significantly  in the  1970s  and acceler- 
ates  greatly  during the  1980s  when  a is moderate  to high. 

To  see  how  alternative  demand  shift  scenarios  compare  with 
the  observed  pattern  of between-sector  demand  shifts  calculated  in 
the  previous  sections,  we  aggregate  the  demand  shift  measures  by 
education-gender  groups  presented  in Table VI into  demand  shifts 
for  college  equivalents  relative  to  high  school  equivalents.  Table 
VIII  compares  these  shifts  with  movements  in  the  relative  supply 
of  college  equivalents.  Our  demand  shift  index  implies  that  the 
relative  demand  for  college  graduates  increased  by  10.2  percent 
from  1971-1979  and by 9.9 percent  from  1979-1987.  There  is little 
direct  indication  of  an  acceleration  in  the  growth  of  the  relative 
demand  for more highly  educated  workers  from these  demand  shift 
indices.  On the  other  hand,  our analysis  of the  nature  of the  bias in 
these  indices  indicates  that  the  demand  shift  index understates  the 
""true"" between-sector  growth  for college graduates  relative  to high 
school  graduates  in  the  1980s  and  overstates  the  shifts  in  the 
1970s.  Furthermore,  the  overall  demand  shift  measure  masks  a 
combination  of  a  deceleration  in  measured  between-industry  de- 
in  measured  within-industry 
mand  shifts  and  an  acceleration 
demand  shifts  from the  1970s  to the  1980s.  The measured  demand 
shifts  explain  about  one  third  of the  implied  trend  demand  shifts 
consistent  with  the  observed  time  series  of prices and quantities. 

B. Experience  Differentials 

We  next  examine  explanations  for  movements  in  experience 
differentials  for  males  over  the  1963-1987  period.  We  focus  on 
males,  since  our  measure  of  potential  experience  is  likely  to  be  a 
worse  indicator  of actual  experience  for wtnuen  than  for imen  We 

CHANGES  IN  RELATIVE  WAGES,  1963-1987 

73 

take the  ratio of the wage of males  with  26 to 35 years  of experience 
(old workers  or peak earners)  to the wage  of males  with  1 to 5 years 
of experience  (young  workers  or new  entrants)  as the  relative  price 
to be explained. 

The  path  of  the  log  old/young  wage  differential  for  all  males 
over  our  sample  period  is  presented  in  Panel  A  of  Figure  V.  The 
overall  old/young  wage  differential  for  males  was  reasonably 
constant  from  the  mid-1960s  to  1970,  increased  sharply  in  the 
early  1970s,  remained  stable  in  the  late  1970s,  and  increased 
greatly  in the  1980s.  The log old/young  wage  differential  increased 
by approximately  0.12  over  the  entire  period.  The  time  pattern  of 
the  changes  in experience  differentials  for all men  is dominated  by 
changes  for those  with  less  than  sixteen  years  of schooling.  Panel  D 
of Figure  I showed  that  experience  differentials  increased  markedly 
from  1979  to  1987  for  high  school  graduates  and  actually  fell  for 
college  graduates  over the  same  period.  These  sharp  differences  in 
a  period  of  rising  education  differentials  are  suggestive  of  the 
""active  labor  market""  hypothesis  of  Freeman  [1975]  in  which 
in  the  labor  market  show  up  most  sharply  for  new 
changes 
entrants  because  more  senior  workers  are  insulated  by  labor 
market  institutions,  such  as  seniority  layoff systems,  and valuable 
firm-specific  capital.  In particular,  the  collapse  of new  employment 
in  the  manufacturing 
opportunities 
sector  in  the  1980s  is  likely  to  have  had  its  most  severe  impact  on 
young  less-educated  males. 

for  less-educated  workers 

We first examine  the  ability  of changes  in the  relative  supply of 
more- to less-experienced  workers  to explain  changes  in experience 
differentials.  Table  II indicates  that  the  relative  supply  of workers 
with  one to ten years  of experience  increased  greatly  over the  entire 
1963-1987  period  but  actually  declined  in  the  1980s  as  the  baby 
boom  cohort  workers  became  more  experienced  and the  baby bust 
cohort  entered  the  labor market.  This  suggests  that  the  growth  in 
relative  supply  of  young  workers  can  help  explain  the  secular 
growth  in experience  differentials  but  will  have  trouble  explaining 
changes  in  the  1980s.  On the  other  hand,  the  fraction  of workers 
with  eleven  to twenty  years  of experience  grew rapidly in the  1980s, 
and it is a priori unclear  how an expansion  of the  supply  of workers 
in this  group  affects  the  earnings  of new  entrants  relative  to  peak 
earners. 

We  attempt  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  how  multidimensional 
changes  in  the  age  structure  of  the  labor  force  affect  the  relative 
earnings  of old to young  workers by using  a relative  supply variable

that  aggregates  all  experience  groups  into  two  groups  (old  and 
young  equivalents).  The  construction  of  this  variable  is  exactly 
analogous  to  the  construction  of  college  and  high  school  equiva- 
lents  above.  We treat  workers  with  26  to  35 years  of experience  as 
pure  old  equivalents  and  those  with  1 to  5 years  of  experience  as 
pure  young  equivalents.  We  allocate  workers  in  the  five  other 
five-year  experience  brackets  (6-10,  11-15,  16-20,  21-25,  36-40 
years)  to  our  two  aggregate  groups  on  the  basis  of  regressions 
(without  intercepts)  of  their  wages  on  the  wages  of  those  with 
26-35  and  1-5  years  of experience.22 

We display the  time  path  of the  log relative  supply  of young  to 
old equivalents  in panel  B of Figure  V. The basic movements  in the 
relative  supply  of young  to  old  equivalents  look  quite  similar  to  a 
smoothed  version  of  the  changes  in  the  old/young  wage  ratio 
illustrated  in  panel  A  of  the  figure.  In  particular,  the  long-term 
is  quite  consistent  with  the 
growth  in  experience  differentials 
long-term  increase  in  the  share  of young  equivalent  workers.  Yet 
the  timing  of the  changes  in  experience  differentials  (particularly 
movements  in  the  mid-1970s  and  the  1980s)  does  not  match  up 
well  with  the  smoothly  declining  rate  of  growth  of  the  relative 
supply of young  equivalents. 

These  points  are brought  out by a comparison  of movements  in 
actual  experience  differentials  and  the  predicted  values  from  a 
regression  over  the  1963-1987  of the  log old/young  wage  ratio  on 
the  log relative  supply of old to young  equivalents.23 The actual  and 
predicted  values  from  this  regression  are  contrasted  in  panel  C of 
Figure  V. The  regression  does  a good job  of explaining  the  secular 
growth  in  experience  differentials  but  fails  to  explain  the  sharp 
increase  in the  1980s.  The active  labor market  hypothesis  suggests 
that  a  weak  market  for  less-educated  workers  may  help  explain 
widening  experience  differentials  for  less-educated  workers  since 
young  less-educated  workers  will  bear  the  brunt  of adjustment  to 
changing  market  conditions.  The  addition  of the  log  of the  overall 
college/high  school  wage  ratio  to  our  specification  (essentially  as a

VII.  CONCLUSIONS 

A  simple  supply  and  demand  framework  helps  illuminate 
many  aspects  of changes  in  the  U.  S. wage  structure.  The  relative 
wages  and  quantities  of  more-educated  workers  and  women  in- 
creased  substantially  from  1963  to  1987.  Within-group  and overall 
wage inequality  also increased  sharply over this  period. Substantial 
secular  growth  in the  demand  for more-educated  workers,  females 
and ""more-skilled""  workers  within  groups is necessary  to interpret 
the  observed  changes  in  relative  wages  as  changes  in  competitive 
skill  prices.  Measured  changes  in  the  allocation  of  labor  demand 
between  sectors  (150  industry-occupation  cells)  can  account  for  a 
large minority  of the  secular  demand  shifts  in favor of groups  with 
rising  relative  wages.  Demand  shifts  arising  from  changes 
in 
international  change  in manufacturing  only start to be of quantita- 
tive  significance  with  the  appearance  of large  trade  deficits  in  the 
1980s.  The  majority  of  the  required  demand  shifts  in  favor  of 
more-educated  workers  and  females  reflect  difficult  to  measure 
changes  in  within-sector  relative  labor  demand.  Recent  work  by 
Krueger  [1991]  suggests  that  the  spread  of  computers 
in  the 
workplace  may be  an  important  component  of these  within-sector 
changes  in the  composition  of labor demand. 

The pattern  of changes  in the  wage  structure  differed substan- 
tially  in  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s.  The  college  wage  premium 
increased  moderately  in  the  1960s,  declined  in  the  1970s,  and 
expanded  dramatically  in  the  1980s.  Differences  across  the  three 
decades  in the  rate  of the  growth  of the  supply  of college  graduates 
as a fraction  of the  labor force appear to  play an important  role  in 
explaining  these  large  differences  in  the  behavior  of  the  relative 
earnings  of college  graduates.  Fluctuations  in the  rate  of growth  of 
relative  supply  do  not  greatly  help  illuminate  differences  across 

24.  The  regression  of the  log  relative  earnings  of  old to  young  males  (RE)  on 
the  log relative  supply  of old to young  equivalents  (RSUP)  and the  log of the  overall 
college/high  school wage premium  (CHSPREM)  yields  a coefficient  (standard  error) 
of  -0.348 
(0.028)  on  RSUP  and  of  0.292  (0.106)  on  CHSPREM  and  has  an  R2 of 
0.87.

decades  in  changes  in  the  male/female  wage  differential.  Within- 
group  earnings  inequality  was  stable  in  the  1960s  and  has  in- 
creased  steadily  since  the  early  1970s.  The  differences  in  the  time 
pattern  of  rising  education  differentials  and  rising  within-group 
inequality  suggest  that  they  are at least  partially  distinct  economic 
phenomena. 

Much  recent  work  indicates  that  economic  pressures  toward 
increased  inequality  and  skill  differentials  arising  from  between- 
in  labor  demand  and  skill-biased  technological 
industry  shifts 
change  appear  important  in  most  OECD  economies  in  the  1980s 
(e.g.,  Gottschalk  and  Joyce  [1991];  Katz  and  Loveman  [1990]). 
Although  wage  structures  appear  to  have  started  to  expand  in 
almost  all  OECD  countries  by  the  middle  of  the  1980s,  the 
magnitude  of the  changes  varies  substantially.  The extent  to which 
this  divergence  in  wage  structure  changes  across  countries 
is 
explained  by differences  in the  supply  and demand  factors  empha- 
sized  in  this  paper  as  opposed  to  differences 
in  wage-setting 
institutions  is an important  topic for future  research.

In a recent speech, President Bush acknowledged a problem that economists and policy makers have long
been concerned about: the growth of economic inequality. The president went on to offer this explanation
for the growth in unequal economic outcomes:

“The reason is clear: We have an economy that increasingly rewards education and skills because of that
education.”1

In fact, there is no evidence that the recent growth in income inequality is due to increased rewards to
education. To the contrary, for the first few years of this business cycle, the college premium-the wage
advantage to college educated workers-actually fell slightly, implying other factors are responsible for
inequality’s recent resurgence.

First, let us be very clear: the earnings advantage to persons with higher levels of education is one of the
most persistent findings in economics. And for many years, that advantage was growing: not only did
college educated workers earn more than persons with only a high school degree, but the difference grew
quickly, particularly over the 1980s.

Second, there are clear and obvious advantages-economic and social-to achieving higher levels of
education, both for individuals and for society.

That said, policy makers too often, like the president, reduce the growth of inequality to this sole factor,
even when the evidence points elsewhere. Here, we collect a number of those facts.

The chart  shows the trend in the college wage premium just noted, adjusted for the set of relevant factors
that labor economists typically control for in this type of analysis, including age, race, gender, region
where workers live, and marital status. The college premium increased from 25% in the late 1970s, to
45% in the late 1990s and has since flattened, even trailing off a bit in the early 2000s, before ticking up
slightly in 2005. Thus, the argument that employers’ skill demands were bidding up the wage premium to
those with more education was arguably true (other factors were involved here too, noted below) over the
1980s and 1990s, but not in the 2000s.

Next, though the inequality debate references relative wages-the earnings of one education group
compared to another-note that the actual inflation adjusted earnings of college graduates rose very little
over this business cycle. Between 2000 and 2006, hourly wages of workers with a college degree (B.A.
only) grew by only 1.4%. This wage estimate omits fringe benefits, and as these costs rose over the

period, a full compensation measure would show more growth, but Gould  (2006) shows that the share of
college-educated workers with employer-provided health care fell by about 3.6 percentage points, 2000-
05. (Gould finds larger coverage losses among less-educated workers.)

In a similar vein, Allegretto  (2007) shows that the employment rates of young college graduates (the
share of young college graduates that are employed) are still recovering from the cyclical decline in their
employment rates that occurred between 2000 and 2003. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for employment
rates of persons 25 and up show that since the peak of the last business cycle (March 2001), the only
group whose employment rates are up is high school dropouts. Those of college graduates are down 1.2
percentage points.

Together, these data show that the wages of college graduates have improved only slightly since 2000 and
have not improved more than high school educated workers. Also, college graduates are now less likely
to be employed than in 2000.

None of this implies that college graduates are worse off than other groups-in some cases, as in employer-
provided health coverage, they have lost less ground than those with less education. But neither are they
insulated from negative trends that have beset the workforce at large, a key point to which we return
below. Equally important, there does not seem to be an insatiable demand by employers for college
graduates that is leading them to improve the wages and benefits of such workers.

We noted above that while increased skill demands were certainly one force in play behind the trend in
the chart, other factors were also driving up the wage gap. For example, less educated workers are more
likely to earn the minimum wage, and its real value fell steeply over the 1980s. Persistent, growing trade
deficits and globalization also dealt a blow to the U.S. manufacturing sector over these years, leading to
the loss of high-quality jobs for non-college-educated workers and putting downward pressure on wages
among similarly skilled workers. Similarly, union representation has been declining, another important
reason for greater inequality. Finally, unemployment was high, on average, over the years when the
premium grew most quickly. When unemployment fell sharply in the latter 1990s, the growth of the wage
gap slowed, suggesting that the absence of full employment, and the diminished bargaining power
associated with slack labor markets, is another factor that must not be overlooked.

In other words, wage inequality is driven by a slew of factors, of which differences in education is but
one. More recently, in the 2000s, the evidence shows no evidence of increasing skill demands, or at least
no evidence that these demands are not being met by enough skilled workers. Instead, in recent years, it
appears the inequality has largely been driven by increased concentration of income and wealth at the
very top of the scale. The current inequality is much more than a simple skills story-persons like CEOs
and holders of large capital assets hold a privileged position that has enabled them to steer the bulk of
growth their way.

Sure, many of these persons have college degrees, but as our and others’ data show, a college degree,
even an advanced degree, does not guarantee entry in this rarified club (see, for example, our analysis  of
recent inequality trends). In fact, our own research shows that half of the growth in wage inequality over

the 1980s, and most of the growth in the 2000s, occurred within education groups, meaning that
inequality’s growth is currently being driven by the gains of some college graduates relative to others
with the same education credentials.

2

Policy makers and analysts must avoid reducing the inequality debate to a sole explanation regarding
education. For any individual making a decision about their future, and for any society contemplating
useful investments, education is an obvious and important area to consider. But it is not solely responsible
for the growth of inequality, not over the longer term, and especially not in recent years. Thus, other
policies-minimum wages, a level playing field for union organizing, health care and pension provision,
work supports for low-income workers, full employment, and responding to the downsides of
globalization-also need to be pursued.

13,"College Premium: Better Pay, Better Prospects

By Catherine Rampell 

February 19, 2013 7:58 pm

I’ve written before about the growing wage premium for college degrees: how the wage
gap between workers with a bachelor’s degree and workers with no more than a high school
diploma has been growing over the years.

But that statistic captures only part of the income premium that people with a bachelor’s

degree enjoy as a result of completing college.

As I report in an article in Wednesday’s paper, people with college diplomas are much
more likely to get jobs, period, than people without the credential. Part of college graduates’
income premium, then, comes from the fact that they are just more likely to be employed in a
typical week. They are probably more likely to work the number of desired hours they wish
to work, too, according to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

You can see this in the unemployment numbers: The jobless rate for people with a

bachelor’s degree was 3.7 percent in January, versus 8.1 percent for those with no more than
a high school diploma.

Census estimates of median annual earnings help capture the college income premium.

In 2011, the median male college graduate earned 1.95 times as much as the median male
whose highest educational attainment was a high school diploma. In 1991, that ratio was
1.76. For women, the ratio is up, but not by as much: It was 2.03 in 2011 versus 1.99 in 1991,
and it dipped in the intervening years.

Here’s a chart showing these earnings ratios over the last two decades:

When I’ve written about this subject before, I’ve been criticized for lumping in people

with advanced degrees with workers with no more than a college diploma, when the job
prospects for those two groups might be very different. But even if you compare the workers

with no more than a college degree with workers with no more than a high school diploma,
the ratio in their median annual earnings has still been rising. (The darker lines in the chart
above refer to the ratio in annual median earnings for workers with exactly a college degree,
and no further education, compared to workers with exactly a high school diploma; the
lighter lines show the ratio for all college grads compared to those with exactly a high school
diploma.)

By the way, the Census Bureau numbers refer only to workers who have at least some

earnings; they exclude people who have no earnings at all. Since a higher percentage of
college grads than high school grads have at least some annual earnings — and since this
differential has increased over the last 20 years, particularly for men — then these Census
earnings numbers will actually understate the increase in the total earnings premium from
college completion, as Mr. Burtless noted to me in an e-mail.

If recent trends continue — with employers increasingly demanding that job candidates

show up to their interview with a sheepskin in hand — we should expect that the wage and
employment advantage conferred upon college grads will only grow.

College can bring a lot of debt, yes. But these figures serve as a reminder that college

also brings huge returns relative to how you might otherwise invest your tuition money.

This paper performs a meta-analysis to investigate how changes over time, model specifications, 
differences in data sets, and variable definitions could contribute to the differences in estimates of returns 
to education in China. The results show that approximately 10 percent of the variation can be explained 
by changes in labor market over time, while the other 45 percent can be explained by differences in 
samples used and empirical methods. Return to education has increased approximately 0.2 percentage 
points a year since the economic reform, and increases more quickly as the reform progresses; however, 
this accelerating trend has reached a stop in the last few years when the global recession hit China. We 
also find that returns to education for rural-to-urban migrant workers are 2.3 percentage points lower than 
that of urban workers. We conclude that the increasing reward for human capital accumulation over time 
signals that China is moving toward a well functioning labor market.

1.  Introduction 

 

The labor market reform is one of the most important aspects of China’s market-oriented 

reform since the late 1970s. Prior to 1978, the wage system in pre-reform China deliberately compressed 

wage differentials across skill levels and occupations to provide egalitarian incomes for all workers. 

Under such a system, the conventional pattern of positive returns to education could not prevail. As China 

drifts away from the planned economy, returns to education are likely to rise. Return to education can be 

an indicator to assess the progress of the reform.  

Earlier studies conclude that returns to education in China until the mid-1980s were non-

existent or close to zero (Byron and Manaloto, 1990; Jamison and Van Der Gaag, 1987; Gregory and 

Meng, 1995; Knight and Song, 1991). More recent studies find a positive return to schooling as high as 

10.2% (Li, 2003; Heckman and Li, 2004; de Brauw and Rozelle, 2008; Giles et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 

2007; Maurer-Fazio, 1999; Li et al., 2012). However, it would be too hasty to conclude that China’s labor 

market functions as well as those in market economies. The differences in estimation can arise even 

without an improvement in the true return to education. For example, more recent works often use more 

sophisticated econometric estimation techniques—such as instrumental variable analysis, or twin studies 

with family fixed effects. More recently collected datasets can also have more clearly-defined wage 

variables.  

The objective of this paper is to determine the extent to which the variation in estimates for 

returns to education from different studies could be due to the difference in estimation methods, sampling 

population, data collection, and most importantly, an improvement in labor market conditions in China. 

We decompose the reasons for an increase in returns to education using a meta-analysis estimation. To 

our knowledge, this is the first study to perform a meta-analysis on the returns to schooling in China. To 

construct the meta-data, we first conduct an extensive literature review focusing on papers that provide 

estimates for returns to education starting from 1975, and we find 43 relevant papers and 371 estimates 

for returns to education spanning from 1975 to 2008.  We record the empirical method used, the 

 

1 

characteristics of the sample population, the year the data was collected and whether the regressions 

include specific sets of controls for each of the regression estimates. To extend the estimate to a more 

current period, we include our own estimations of return to education using the 1991 to 2009 waves of 

China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).  

We find that approximately 10 percent of the variation in estimates for return to education can 

be explained by changes in labor market over time, while the other 45 percent can be explained by 

differences in samples used and empirical methods.  The returns to education are close to zero in both 

urban and rural areas in the early stage of reform, but they have increased at 0.21 percentage points a year 

in the past 30 years. More interestingly, we find that return to education increases more quickly as the 

reform progresses; however, this accelerating trend has reached a stop in the last few years when the 

global recession hit China. This increasing trend is similar for both urban and rural, male and female sub-

samples. One note is that we also find that returns to education for rural-to-urban migrant workers are 2.3 

percentage points lower than that of urban workers.  

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the background of China’s 

labor market before and after the reform separated by urban and rural areas. Section 3 provides an 

overview of the econometric framework used in the existing literature. Section 4 describes the dataset for 

meta-analysis and the estimates of returns to education using the CHNS dataset.  Section 5 presents the 

results from the meta-analysis and Section 6 concludes. 

 

2.  Background of the labor market in China 

 

The late political scientist Gordon White once said that of all planning aspects of China prior to 

the reform, “the allocation of labor resources is by far the furthest from the market mechanism” (White, 

1988). In this section, we will provide some description about various reforms that took place in urban 

and rural labor markets.   

2.1 Urban Labor Market 

 

2 

               Before the market-oriented reform in 1978, the Bureau of Labor and Personnel had immense 

power since it was in charge of job assignments. For a typical urban resident, upon completing some 

education level, she would be assigned to work in one of the state agencies, which can be state-owned 

enterprises (SOE) or government institutions (Cai 2003). Her initial assignment of work unit would be 

determined by her education attainment, field of studies, and at times her family class origin.1 Besides her 

work unit, she would be assigned as a factory worker/technician (gongren/jigong) or an administrative or 

managerial worker (ganbu). The initial assignment is extremely important since job change across work 

places or even within a workplace was very rare (Knight and Song, 1991).  

Her wage was determined through a wage grade system: eight grades for factory 

workers/technicians and 24 to 28 grades for administrative and managerial workers (Meng and Kid, 1997; 

Zhang et al., 2005).2  Being promoted to a higher wage grade depended on seniority (Knight and Song, 

1991; 1999). Thus her monthly wages did not really reflect her ability and productivity. Her wage would 

be kept at a low level (Zhang et al., 2005), but she would receive various benefits and in-kind transfers, 

including food and housing rationing, free education for her family, medical care and pension.3  Such a 

wage system ensured every urban worker a lifetime employment (as known as “iron rice bowl”, 

tiefanwan), especially because employers could not recruit and dismiss workers freely (Meng and Kid, 

1997). 

                                                 
1 The family class origin depends on one’s family background during China’s Civil War with the Kuomingtan. 
Family class origin can be categorized into “Five Red Elements” (hongwulei), “Middle Class” or “Five Black 
Elements” (heiwulei). “Five Red Elements” refers to the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary cadres, 
production workers, poor peasants, extremely poor and mid-lower peasants. The “Five Red Elements” enjoyed the 
highest social and political status as well as the most government-provided resources (including better education and 
employment opportunity) during the cultural revolution between 1966 to 1976. Middle class were pre-liberation 
peddlers and store clerks, and former middle-class peasants.  “Five Black Elements” includes landlords, rich farmers 
and counter-revolutionaries. (Deng and Treiman, 1997). 
2 Various papers report different number of grades. Knight and Song (1991) report that factory workers were divided 
into 8 grades, technicians were divided into 17 grades and administrative and managerial workers (ganbu) were 
divided into 20 grades. This probably was due to the fact that the wage system was first established in 1956 and 
adjusted several times in 1963, 1971-1972, 1977-1978 and 1978-1979.  
3 Since wages were kept low, benefits and in-kind transfers were an important part of total income. However, market 
value of these benefits and in-kind transfers were difficult to estimate precisely, especially when the commodity 
markets hardly exist. We would like to point out that in most earlier studies on returns to education, the true returns 
to education in pre-reform China could be underestimated since these benefits and in-kind transfers could also 
depend on one’s education level (Peng, 1992).

The urban labor market reform started in the late 1970s following the commodity market reform. 

We will describe the labor market reform from three dimensions: the introduction of labor contract, the 

wage reform and mass lay-off of workers from state-owned enterprises.  

The introduction of labor contracts dismantled the “iron rice bowl” and allowed job mobility. 

Starting in 1983, graduates could choose either to be assigned by the Bureau of Labor and Personnel or 

they were allowed to seek employment opportunities in both state agencies and private firms (Brook and 

Tao, 2003).  In the same year, a labor contract system was introduced to selected SOE new employees 

(Knight and Song, 1991). 4 A typical contract specified the duration, the responsibilities, and the benefits 

of employment. Most importantly, either party could choose not to renew this contract when it expired 

(Liu, 1998). In 1985, less than four percent of the urban labor force had a contract (Meng, 2004). In 1986, 

a new order was issued by the government and the new labor contract system gradually spread to all 

SOEs (Meng and Kidd, 1997). By 1995, nearly 40 percent of the urban labor force was under contract 

(Meng, 2000).  

         As for wage reform, the transition from a wage grade system to a more flexible wage system started 

in the early 1980s. Under the new wage system, the wage of each employee has three main components: 

basic wage (jibengongzi), functional wage (gangweigongzi) and floating wage (jiangging). The basic 

wage was derived from the old wage grade system; the functional wage depends on one’s position in the 

firm; and the floating wage, which was determined at the firm level, was a flexible element that reflected 

individual performance and employer’s profitability (Knight and Song, 2003). The share of basic wage 

declined rather slowly from 86 percent in 1978 to 56 percent in 1988 and to 47 percent in 1993.  

The central government implemented a series of reforms in SOE aiming to improve the efficiency of 

the state sector. In particular, middle- and large-sized SOE and collectively-owned enterprises laid off 

over 25 million employees from 1997 to 2002 (also known as xiagang). Most of these workers were 

middle-aged workers with low skills and poor education (Maurer-Fazio and Dinh, 2004). The government 
                                                 
4 In 1981, the earliest experiment of the labor contract was implemented in selected SOE in Guangdong, Jiangsu and 
Shanghai (Meng and Kidd, 1997). These labor contracts did not cover existing employees. (China Ministry of Labor 
and Social Security, 1998).

established re-employment centers to help the laid-off workers to find jobs. Employment was no longer 

guaranteed, and one’s education level played an important role during this re-employment process and in 

the determination of their earnings in private sectors (Maurer-Fazio and Dinh, 2004). Those workers who 

could not find jobs in the first few years after being laid off received some governmental supports.5, 6 

2.2 Rural Nonfarm Labor Market 

               Prior to the reform, both the rural agricultural and off-farm production were operated under a 

three-tier system. The three-tier system consists of three administrative and production tiers: People’s 

commune (gongshe), brigade (lv), and production team (shengchandui).7 Under the three-tier system, 

commune and brigade leaders determined all economic activities, including production plans, agricultural 

and industrial inputs, labor assignments and output distribution. Each individual was assigned to a 

production team and worked on a farm or at a local factory. 8 The rural non-farm sector did not play a 

major role in the pre-reform period. Most rural industries were opened and operated by local communes 

and brigades to provide sideline agricultural products and services, such as agricultural machinery, farm 

tools, chemical fertilizer and handicrafts (Meng, 2000; Zhang et al., 2004). For their off-farm work, 

farmers were paid under a work point system. Points were given to members for each day of work.  The 

number of points a person could receive in a day was determined by his or her gender, age and health 

status (e.g. healthy, young men normally received higher points per day of work). Education and 

productivity were irrelevant for one’s pay.  

           Starting in 1983, these collective enterprises (previously owned by a commune, brigade or 

production team) were renamed as Township and Village-owned Enterprises (TVE, xiangzhenqiye) and 

they were given more freedom in production planning, wage schedules and recruitment. TVE could hire 
                                                 
5 The unemployment and social security systems were established in 1986, but they were not enforced until 1993. A 
small allowance was provided to SOE laid-off workers.  
6 There were many other concurrent reforms that can have some impact on the labor market, such as pension reform 
and the expansion of college education. Since they are not the focus of this paper, we do not discuss them here. 
Leung (2003) provides a detailed description of the pension reforms.   
7 People’s commune was set up in the mid-1950s in rural China. The population of a typical commune ranged from 
15,000 to 30,000 while the average size of a team was about 167 people. (Gregory and Meng 1995; Li and Zhang 
1998) 
8 The term “enterprise” (qiye) was hardly used in pre-reform China because the term was connected to capitalism. 
These collectively-owned factories are the predecessors of town and village enterprises during the reform.

local off-farm laborers as full time employees, and this was possible because of the concurrent 

agricultural reform—known as the  “Household Responsibility System” (Lin, 1992). 9  With the 

“household responsibility system” and the improvement in agricultural production efficiency, much of 

rural farming labor now became free. TVE absorbed a large portion of rural laborers and become a major 

employer in the rural non-farm labor market. Between 1978 and 2000, the number of rural non-farm 

worker grew from 21.8 to 151.6 million (Fleisher et al. 2003). 10  The work-point wage system in pre-

reformed rural collectives was replaced by a piece-rate wage system under which monthly wages were 

determined based on individual work effort and enterprise profits (Meng, 1996; Fleisher and Wang, 

2004).11 

              Prior to reform, rural-urban labor mobility was strictly prevented under the household 

registration system, also known as hukou. Since jobs were assigned centrally, without an urban hukou, a 

rural resident simply could not obtain a job in an urban area (Liang and Ma, 2003). Most people born into 

a rural community stayed there for their entire life. An important part of the reforms was the weakening 

of the household registration system. Starting in 1983, the central government gradually relaxed the 

restrictions on mobility, and rural residents were allowed to seek jobs in nearby urban enterprises. The 

restriction on rural-urban labor mobility was further relaxed when the government allowed rural residents 

to seek jobs in any city in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Cai, 2003; Fleisher and Yang, 2003; de Brauw 

and Rozelle, 2008).12 As a result, a massive rural to urban migration has taken place. According to Zhao 

                                                 
9 China’s economic reform in the agricultural sector first started by introducing the “Household Responsibility 
System” (HRS). Each production team could now divide the collectively-owned land and rent out to its member 
households for up to 15 years (then extended to another 30 years in 1990s) (Wang, 2007). Under the “Household 
Responsibility System”, households’ responsibility to the government is to fulfill the grain procurement quota 
(gongliang). Households could make their own farming decisions such as the amount of input used, type of grains 
planted, etc, and any output above the quota could be sold in the market and households could keep the profits. 
Between 1978 and 1995, total grain yield increased 3% annually and rural household income increased 7.3% 
annually (Meng, 2000).  
10 While the government did encourage skilled craftsmen to establish their own businesses in 1983-1985 (Fleisher 
and Yang 2003; de Brauw et al. 2002), the share of the labor force that worked in private sectors for both rural and 
urban areas was still less than 1 percent by the late 1980s (National Bureau of Statistics, 1990).   
11 Byrd and Lin (1989) provide  more elaborate details about the post-reform rural industry. 
12 Several major reforms are relevant for labor mobility as follows: in 1985, the procurement quota was replaced by 
the new purchasing contracts between the state and rural households. Under the new system, rural residents do not 
have the obligation to fulfill the grain production quota (Fleisher and Yang, 2006). Second, starting in 1986, the 

 

6 

(2000) and Meng et al. (2010), the estimated number of rural-urban migrants is approximately 12.1 

million during 1980-1985 and this number reached 38.9 million in 1997.13 Starting in 1997, the migrants 

with stable source of income and housing could apply for urban hukou, but this policy was mainly applied 

to small towns and medium-sized cities. In most provincial capital cities and metropolitan areas, such as 

Beijing and Shanghai, the chance of obtaining an urban hukou for rural migrants is still very slim (Brook 

and Tao, 2003; Fleisher and Yang, 2006). By 2000, an estimated 61.3 million rural residents had moved 

to urban areas, while this number reached 125.8 million by 2006 (Meng et al., 2010).  

A few studies suggest that rural migrants are being discriminated against in the urban labor 

market.  Using the data collected in Shanghai in 1995/1996, Meng and Zhang (2001) find that rural 

migrants mostly take jobs that the urban residents are unwilling to take. Even when the rural migrants 

work in the same enterprise as the urban workers, they are also paid less. While the Chinese government 

passed laws protecting workers in the late 1990s and 2000s, including regulations on contract, insurance, 

work hours, etc., Frijters et al. (2010) use data from 2008 and find that rural migrant workers still work 

longer working hours and receive lower wages and worse remuneration packages compared to their urban 

counterparts. Using a 2002 dataset, a study by Demurger et al. (2009) tries to break down urban residents’ 

and migrants’ earning differentials, and they suggest that most of the differences in migrant and urban 

workers’ earnings can be explained by the differences in individual characteristics—such as education.   

Figure 1 plots the distribution of full-time workers at SOE, TVE and private sectors. As shown in 

Figure 1, prior to the reform, SOE were the biggest employers and absorbed nearly 80% of urban labor. In 

                                                                                                                                                             
central government started issuing identification cards (shenfenzheng) and rural citizens with a legal I.D. card could 
freely migrate to cities.  In 1993, the urban food rationing system was abolished and migrants with rural hukou could 
buy food and other goods in urban commodity markets (Cai, 2003). However, even today there are still other 
institutional barriers stopping rural residents from moving to urban areas. For example, only those with urban hukou 
can send their children to urban public school and enjoy urban resident health insurance. For difficulties faced by 
migrant workers see Chapter 2 and Chapter 5 of Meng, Manning, Li and Effendi (2010).  
13 According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the Ministry of Agriculture (2001), the total “floating 
population” (liudongrenkou) was approximately 20 million in 1983 while this number reached 30 million in 1987 
and 70 million in 1995. Comparing to the official statistics, the estimates from Zhao (2000) and Meng et al. (2010) 
seem small. However, the “floating population” in the official NBS statistics covers all internal migrants—including 
rural-rural, rural-urban and urban-urban migrants (Duan and Sun 2006).

Figure 2 displays the trend of average wage by ownership units over time.14 

 

3.  Mincer Equation and Returns to Education Literature in China 

The standard labor economics model of estimating returns to education is the Mincer equation 

(1974): 

ln(

(1) 

where yi  is the earnings of individual i, Si is a measure of schooling, Xi’ is a vector of covariates such as 

experience and the quadratic term of experience, and μi is an error term. The main outcome of interest in 

this study is β, the coefficient on education. Among the papers estimating the Mincer equation in China, 

several empirical methods are employed, and we discuss their methodologies in detail in this Section.  

            

3.1.  OLS estimation and Unobserved Ability 

The basic assumption of OLS estimation for Mincer equation (1) is that the explanatory variables 

are uncorrelated with the error term, μi. However, this assumption may be violated. For example, 

individual ability, which could be a determinant of wage, is missing from the Mincer equation. Ability 

can be correlated with education, which leads to a biased estimate of β. One approach to resolve the 

potential bias is to directly control for ability using some proxies. The proxies that have been used include 

parental education and parental income (Heckman and Li, 2004; Li and Luo, 2004; de Brauw and Rozelle, 

2008; Giles et al., 2007). However, the inclusions of these proxies are not without criticism. There could 

still be aspects of ability that are not captured in one’s parental education/skills.  

3.2.   Twins data and Other Unobserved Variables  

                                                 
14 Zhang et al. (2005) provides an extensive overview of returns to education for state sector, collective sector and 
non-public (non-state) sector from 1988-2001. According to their estimates, the return to education in the private 
sector was higher than that of state and TVE sectors during this period. Private firms have more flexibility in labor 
hiring and wage schedule and the scale of the private sector grew quickly. 

 

8 

In addition to ability, other unobserved family characteristics could also be correlated with 

individual education level and earnings. One innovative approach that attempts to address this issue is the 

use of twins samples. The key idea of twins studies is that monozygotic twins should be similar in family 

upbringing and genetically determined ability. Unobserved differences that bias our estimate of β can be 

eliminated with the use of family fixed effects.15  This approach has been pursued in estimating the return 

to education in the United States and the United Kingdom (Ashenfelter and Krueger, 1994; Behrman et al., 

1994; Ashenfelter and Rouse, 1998; Bonjour et al., 2003).  

In China, the datasets including large numbers of twins were not available until the Chinese 

Twins Survey (Li et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012). The Chinese Twins Survey was 

conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in summer 2002 in five cities (Chengdu, 

Chongqing, Harbin, Hefei and Wuhan). It contains information on earnings, education, and job tenure for 

488 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins and 322 pairs of non-identical (DZ) twins.16  One potential problem 

with twin studies is that measurement error problems can be exacerbated by fixed-effect estimates.  The 

Chinese Twins Survey follows Ashenfelter and Krueger’s US Twins Survey design (1994) by asking each 

twin to report their own education level as well as their co-twin’s education level. 

With the Chinese Twins Survey, Zhang et al. (2007) and Li et al. (2007) both use the twins 

dataset to estimate various versions of Mincer Equation. In order to deal with the measure error issue, Li 

et al. (2012) use the cross-reported education by the other twin to instrument for the self-reported 

education level.  

 

3.3.  2SLS and Natural Experiment 

Another approach used to improve on OLS estimates is two-stage least square method (2SLS). 

This approach requires an instrumental variable that is related to one’s education level, but is orthogonal 
                                                 
15 In fact, the variation in education level between twins may be endogenous. For instance, the between-twin 
difference in birth weight is correlated with their IQ and schooling. See Bound and Solon (1999) and Neumark 
(1999) for more discussion.   
16 They consider a pair of twins to be identical if both twins respond that they have identical hair color, looks and 
gender.

to one’s ability. Instruments used in the previous studies include quarter of birth interacted with year of 

birth (Angrist and Krueger, 1991), a school expansion program (Duflo, 2002), and geographical distance 

to schools (Kane and Rouse, 1993; Card 1995).  

In the context of China, both Fleisher and Wang (2005) and Giles et al. (2007) use the differential 

impact of the Cultural Revolution (CR) across time and geographic variation in China as an instrumental 

variable for years of schooling.  During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, formal education was 

disrupted. Many universities were closed for six years and some age cohorts missed as much as eight 

years of schooling (Meng and Gregory, 2002a). Rural schooling was less affected than urban schooling 

(Meng and Gregory, 2002b).  Since there are differences in educational disruption across age cohorts and 

rural/urban areas, Fleisher and Wang (2005) instrument years of schooling with birth year, location (rural, 

small town, medium-size city or metropolitan area), a dummy variable indicating whether any normal 

high-school years occurred during the CR and interaction terms between the location and CR-year 

variable.  

Giles et al. (2007) note that besides the variation in time and location, family background was 

also a key factor in determining the impact of CR on schooling. For example, the children of “Five Black 

Elements” were hit harder than the children of “Five Red Elements”17, and the children whose parents had 

administrative status (ganbu) were less likely to be sent to the countryside. Giles et al. (2007) construct 

different education disruption measures as instruments based on one’s birth place, birth year and parental 

administrative status.18  

3.4  Selection Bias 

One possible source of bias in estimates of the returns to schooling is selection bias (Heckman 

and Li, 2004; de Brauw and Rozelle, 2008; Wang et al., 2009). One example of this is that people sort 

into school based on the heterogeneous return to schooling. For example, those who attend college are the 
                                                 
17 See Footnote 1 for more discussion.   
18 Meng and Gregory (2002) also study the impact of disrupted education during the CR on adult earnings. Since 
they could not control for unobserved cohort differences that are correlated with workers’ experience of schooling, 
shock and workers’ productivity, their findings cannot be extrapolated beyond the impact of the CR on earnings for 
that particular cohort.    

 

10 

ones who know that they will receive higher return to schooling. Using semi-parametric methods, 

Heckman and Li (2004) allow for heterogeneous returns among individuals selecting into schooling based 

on these differences.  Heckman and Li (2004) find that the heterogeneity in returns is substantial in the 

population. OLS gives a downward biased estimate of the average treatment effect. Wang et al. (2009) 

use the same methodology as Heckman and Li (2004) but with a different dataset.  

de Brauw and Rozelle (2007) suggest another type of selection bias. An individual will not enter 

a labor market if his or her reservation wage is higher than the wage offered. The distribution of wages is 

left truncated, thus the OLS estimates will be biased if not correcting for the selection bias. To account for 

the bias, they apply a two-stage Heckman correction method.   

 

4.  Meta-Dataset and Summary Statistics 

In order to construct the meta-dataset, we performed a literature search on the Social Science 

Research Network (SSRN) to identify studies that use the Mincer equation to estimate the returns to 

education in China. We further expanded the list by including any relevant papers mentioned in the set of 

papers we found from SSRN. We found 43 papers that estimate returns to education in China spanning 

the period from 1975 to 2008.19   

In Table 1, we present the estimates by whether the sample populations are urban, rural or 

migrants.20  The estimates reported in Table 1 are either taken directly from the most comparable 

estimation from that study, or they represent the average across several specifications within the same 

study.21 For those studies that use a set of level of education attainment dummies, instead of years of 

                                                 
19 A paper by Fleisher et al. (2011) is not listed in Table 1 and is excluded from our analysis even though they have 
some estimates of returns to schooling, because  the approach is quite different from what we have discussed above. 
Unlike the rest of the papers using individual level data to estimate returns, Fleisher et al. (2011) estimate marginal 
product of skilled labor (MPL) in Cobb-Douglas function and impute the returns to education using MPL.  
20 To our knowledge, there are very few datasets that would allow one to examine the returns to education for a 
migrant population. In recent years, the most structured and representative migrant dataset is the Rural-Urban 
Migration in China and Indonesia (RUMiCI) project. It is a dataset that starts in 2008 and will contain five rounds of 
longitudinal surveys on migrant workers. More information can be found at: http://rse.anu.edu.au/rumici/. 
21 For example, Johnson and Chow (1997) present three estimates for returns to education in urban areas. The first 
one is the basic OLS, and the second includes an interaction term between being a member of the communist party 
and work experience, and the third one includes an interaction term between female and schooling. We choose to 

 

11 

schooling, as independent variables, we annualize the returns across education categories (university, high 

school, middle school and elementary school) to get the average return for a year of schooling. We only 

include the rural studies if they pertained to the off-farm sector.  

            To provide a more current measure of the return to schooling, we estimate Equation (1) using the 

dataset from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The CHNS is a panel survey which covers 

approximately 16,000 individuals in nine provinces in the years 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 

2006 and 2009.22 The 1989 data is excluded from the analysis since the format of the questions on wages 

was changed, making it less comparable to that of later years. The OLS estimates of returns to education 

for both urban and rural areas are provided in Table 2. Table 2 shows that returns to education increase 

over time for both urban and rural off-farm sectors and this increasing trend came to a stop in 2009.  We 

incorporate these estimates into our meta-dataset.23  

Most studies listed in Table 1 have multiple estimates of returns to schooling. For each estimate, 

we would record the model specification (IV, OLS), special correction (ability controls, correction for 

selection bias), the choice of the dependent variable24 (hourly wage, monthly/annual wage, includes in-

kind transfer, subsidies), sample used in regression (female only, male only, pooled; urban only, rural 

only, migrant only; twin), the choices of controls (occupations dummies included, industry dummies 

included, work unit dummies included) and the year the dataset was collected. For example, Zhang et al. 

(2005) estimate the return to schooling for each year from 1988 to 2001.  Their study also provides 

estimation results using alternative specifications such as controlling for industry dummies and 
                                                                                                                                                             
only present the estimate from the basic OLS without any interaction terms, which is more comparable to that of 
other studies.  
22 The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is a project between the Carolina Population Center and the 
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey uses a multistage, random cluster sampling process.. 
CHNS contains detailed demographic, socioeconomic and health information for 4,400 households with a total of 
26,000 individuals.  
23 Unfortunately, we are not able to test the difference between IV and OLS estimates using this dataset due to the 
absence of a good instrument. 
24 Several authors suggest that hourly wage is better than annual or monthly earnings because it does not depend on 
the number of hours worked (Shultz, 1988; Card, 1999). In particular, Li and Zax (2004) find that less educated 
individuals work more in China. Without taking work hours into account, we may underestimate the return to 
education. Thus, the choice of dependent variable matters.  Moreover, earning can be broadly defined to include 
bonuses, subsidies and in-kind transfers as a part of total earning. In the appendix table, we show that inclusion of 
bonuses, subsidies and in-kind transfers does not have a significant impact on estimates for returns to education. 

 

12 

occupation dummies, and separating by gender and different sectors. Therefore, we include a total of 112 

estimates from this study into our meta-dataset, but each of the estimates is unique in some dimension in 

our meta-dataset. In order to assign the same weight to all studies, we create a weighting function which 

is inversely proportional to the number of estimates included from a given study. It is also notable that a 

large fraction of the urban studies use a dataset from 1988. This is because only a handful of micro-level 

datasets are suitable and accessible and can be used to estimate returns to education in China.25 

Table 3 reports the descriptive statistics for the meta-dataset, broken down by urban and rural 

areas. The earliest year that the data covers is 1975 in the urban areas (pre-reform) and 1986 in the rural 

areas (post-reform). The average number of observations in a regression is 3,309 and the average return to 

schooling is 4.8 percent. There are a few other noteworthy aspects of this table.  First, the average return 

to each year of schooling in urban area is about 2.8 percentage points higher than that of the rural off-farm 

sector.26 Second, none of the IV and twins studies were conducted using a rural dataset. There is also no 

rural study that includes industry dummies and estimates for employees in SOE and private sectors and 

rural migrant workers. There are very few studies with migrant samples, so we cannot examine the trend 

of return to schooling for the migrant population. Despite that we discuss the potential bias associated 

with using annual/monthly earning as the dependent variable, only 30 percent of estimates use log of 

hourly wage as the dependent variable. In many of the earlier surveys, hours worked are simply not 

available. In our analysis, we examine whether using hourly wage as opposed to annual/monthly income 

would affect the estimates for returns to education. 

                                                 
25 For example, the dataset from the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) was one of the most popular choices 
for estimating the Mincer equation. It covered four cross-sectional datasets collected in 1988/89, 1995/96, 
1999/2000 and 2002/2003. The sample consists of 17,000 workers in 10 provinces in 1988, 10,913 workers in 11 
provinces in 1995, 6,281 workers in six provinces in 1999 and 9,791 workers in twelve provinces in 2002. It was 
collected by the Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Science.  
26 In studies that measure education using a set of dummies for level of attainment, instead of years of schooling as 
the independent variable, we first sum over rates of return on dummies (university, high school, middle school and 
elementary school) and annualize the sum to estimate the average return to additional year of schooling.

In the next section, we provide the meta-analysis to examine whether the difference in 

estimations among studies can be explained by various model specifications, the passage of time and 

differences in datasets.  

 

5.  Meta-Analysis of the Returns to Schooling Literature  

5.1.  Meta-Analysis Regression Strategy  

Meta-regression analysis is a quantitative method used to analyze a body of related empirical 

literature (Stanley and Jarrell, 1989). One advantage of meta-analysis is that it allows us to quantify the 

changes in coefficient estimates due to differences in empirical specifications used across various studies .  

For example, we can estimate the effect of the inclusion of occupation or industry dummies, or the impact 

of using IV as opposed to OLS on returns to education. It also allows us to examine how returns to 

education have evolved over time by surveying the vast literature in returns to schooling.    

Figure 3 plots the returns over time from the studies included in the meta-analysis; each point 

represents one observation.  The figure reveals an upward trend of returns to schooling over time. The 

few outliers on this figure are from either Heckman and Li (2004) or Wang et al. (2009). As we discuss in 

Section 3, both of these papers correct for selection bias and more importantly, they estimate the returns 

to schooling for college students. It is likely possible that returns to per-year schooling are much higher at 

college level.  In Figure 4, we plot the returns by the area of sample population (urban vs. rural), 

empirical model (OLS vs. IV) and gender (male vs. female), and this upward trend can be observed in 

each of the subgroups. Therefore, we include a time factor in our meta-regression.27  

The meta-regression model can be expressed as follows:

where βijt is the estimated returns to each year of schooling for study i and specification j using dataset 

from year t. We subtract t from 1975, the first year in which return of education is estimated. 1 estimates 
                                                 
27 While it may appear that heteroskedasticity exists, it is possibly due to the fact that very few studies cover the 
earlier period.

the change in returns to schooling across years. Z′ij is a vector of independent variables including ability 

bias control, selection bias control, the use of instrumental variables, twin method, hourly wages as 

dependent variable, occupation, industry, work unit dummies and the specific dataset (CHIP), urban, male, 

female, and migrant dummies indicating whether the estimate is for a specific sub-population. Since there 

are usually multiple observations from each study, unless otherwise noted, the regression standard errors 

are clustered at the study level. As mentioned earlier, the weight of each observation is inversely 

proportional to the number of estimates included in each study, so in each regression each study should 

have the same weight. 

 

5.2.  Main Results: 

Table 4 reports the results for estimating Equation 2. Column 1 estimates Equation 2 exclude 

the time trend, Column 2 estimates Equation 2. We find that differences in econometric specifications 

alone account for nearly 45 percent of the variation in estimates for returns to schooling. When we 

include the time dimension, we can explain an additional 10 percent more of the variation. Coefficient on 

time dimension suggests that returns to education increase at 0.21 percentage points a year between 1975 

and 2009.   

Returns to education that are estimated using instrumental variables are about 3.2-3.6 

percentage points higher than those from OLS. Those studies which use hourly wage instead of 

annual/monthly earning as a dependent variable find higher returns to schooling. We should also note that 

most of the studies with hourly wage available are collected more recently, so once we control for time, 

this coefficient becomes insignificant in Column 2. There are three papers controlling for selection bias 

(Heckman and Li, 2004; Wang et al., 2009; de Brauw and Rozelle, 2008), and the coefficient on selection 

bias is positive and significant. However, one should be cautious to interpret the coefficient as if it is only 

due to the selection bias. While all other studies estimate returns to schooling for all levels of education, 

two out of three papers that correct for selection bias estimate returns to schooling for university students. 

It is possible that return to per-year schooling is higher for college than other levels, thus the positive 

 

15 

significant coefficients on selection bias are partly due to the college student bias. We include a set of 

dummies indicating whether a study controls for occupation, industry and work unit (SOE, TVE or 

Private). Since occupational, industry and work units are various channels by which education can affect 

wages, the inclusion of these dummies also affects one’s estimates in returns to schooling. Fifteen out of 

44 studies use the CHIP dataset, so we include a dummy for that, but it is not significant. The estimated 

return to education in urban areas is about 2 percentage points higher than in the rural areas. Male and 

female dummies indicate if this estimate is specifically for male or female, and the default is the pooled 

sample. Return to education for male is negative but significant suggesting that return to education for 

female is probably higher than male.28 The migrant dummy equals 1 if the sample population is rural-

urban migrant workers. The return to education for rural migrants is 2.39 percentage points lower than 

non-migrant workers.   

Since returns to education have been increasing over time, it would be interesting to see if this 

increasing trend has slowed. Column 3 includes a quadratic term for the time variable. If this term has a 

positive sign, it means that returns to education accelerate in the period of our study. The coefficient on 

the quadratic time variable is positive but insignificant. With the consideration of the recent global 

recession, we exclude the estimates from year 2008 and 2009 in Column 4. It shows that the year square 

term is significantly positive, which indicates that the trend of increasing returns to education is 

accelerating until 2007, when it reaches a stop.29  

In Table 5 we examine whether this increasing trend differs by subsample. Table 5 Columns 1 

and 2 report the results separated by urban versus rural samples; Columns 3 and 4 report results for male 

and female samples. The returns to schooling increase slightly faster in rural areas than urban areas, and 

return to schooling increases faster for female than for male. One striking pattern is that migrant male 

                                                 
28 The finding of higher returns to female education has been documented in the previous literature (Psacharopoulos, 
1994; Li, 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). This difference could be partially due to the greater positive self-selection of 
women into the labor force compared to men (Zhang et al., 2005), and also due to the under-supply of educated 
women on the labor market (Li, 2003). 
29 In the appendix we provide some alternative specifications where we do not use sample weight or do not cluster 
standard errors, and we find consistent patterns. 

 

16 

workers receive about 5 percentage points lower returns to schooling than non-migrant male workers; 

migrant female workers’ returns to schooling are about 6 percentage points lower than non-migrant 

female workers.   

In Table 6, we want to investigate the non-linearity of the increasing return to schooling over 

time. We restrict our sample to only those using an urban, non-migrant sample and divide estimates into 4 

periods: 1975-1988, 1989-1995, 1996-2002 and 2003-2009.30 We did not use a sample weight nor cluster 

the standard errors since there is one paper that produced returns to education for an urban non-migrant 

sample after 2003. Our findings suggest that during the early period of reform in 1975-1988 and 1989-

1995, the returns to education increased at 0.299 percentage and 0.236 percentage points per year, 

respectively.31 Between 1996 and 2002, the returns to education increase at 0.50 percentage points a year, 

but eventually it plateaus in more recent years. In Column 5, we extend the period in Column 3 until 2006, 

and we still find a positive trend even until then. Since there is no data on 2007, we can infer that the 

negative insignificant sign in Column 4 is driven by estimates from 2008 and 2009 when the global 

recession affected China.32 

 

6.  Conclusion 

This study examines the trend of returns to education in China from 1975 to 2009 by 

performing a meta-regression analysis using estimates from over 40 studies. Nearly 45 percent of the 

variation in returns to education is due to the differences in econometric specifications from studies, and 

time progression can explain about 10 percent of the variation. At the onset of the reform, return to 
                                                 
30 This division is based on the consideration of important policy changes and sample size issue. For example, 1975-
1988 is the early stage of reform and many studies use data in 1988. Around 1987 there was a contract law reform, 
and after 1987 the rural-urban migration restriction was gradually relaxed. Around 1997 most large- and medium-
sized SOE laid off many unskilled workers (xiagang) and another wave of wage system reform took place in all 
state sectors.  
31 These two coefficients are not statistically different from each other.   
32 We also add three dummy variables—“Bonus Included”, “Subsidy Included” and “In-kind Transfer Included” into 
our meta-regression, to indicate if wage measure includes bonus, subsidy or in-kind transfer. However, none of these 
variables is significant and results are reported in the Appendix Table. A small set of papers examine return to 
education by work unit (state-owned enterprise, town-village-enterprise and private enterprise). Regression results 
reported in the Appendix suggest that the return to education in private sector is significantly higher (2.2 percentage 
points) than those in SOE, and return to education in TVE is 0.93 percentage points lower than SOE. 

 

17 

education was close to 0, but it has been increasing at 0.2 percentage points per year in the past 30 years. 

Our empirical results show that this upward time trend persists in both urban and rural areas and for both 

male and female. More importantly, for urban workers, this increasing time trend showed no sign of 

abating until 2008 and 2009 when the global recession began to affect China. Our empirical results show 

that this upward time trend persists in both urban and rural areas and for both male and female. However, 

it ought to be of interest and concern to policymakers that rural-to-urban migrant workers receive much 

lower return to education  compared to their urban counterparts.   

An extrapolation of the existing trends into the year 2015 gives the predicted return of 8.44 

percent.  The magnitudes of these returns are equal or close to the levels observed in other Asian 

countries during the period of the 1970s and 1980s (Psacharopoulos, 1994). Increasing rewards for human 

capital accumulation is a positive sign that suggests China is moving gradually towards a market 

economy.

Note: We plot those estimated returns by region, empirical model and gender. In the upper panel, returns 
in urban areas increase more quickly over time than returns in rural areas; in the middle panel, OLS 
estimates are generally smaller than IV estimates; in the bottom, female’s returns to education increase 
faster than male’s.

Note: Each return is derived from a separate regressions. In Column (1) and (2), the dependent 
variable is the log of monthly basic wage from the primary job. In Column (3) and (4), the dependent 
variable is log(hourly wage), and hourly wage is imputed using earning divided by hours worked. We 
restrict to sample older than 18. In Column (1), the covariates includes exp, (exp)2, minority, female, 
province dummies and ownership dummies.  Column (2) includes all covariates listed above plus 
occupation dummies. In Columns (3) and (4), the dependent variable is log (hourly wage). Column (4) 
adds occupation dummies.
 a: Not statistically significant from zero.
